<p>
Today, consumers rarely check out at a business without a cashier asking for their personal information. Systems that were once made of punchcards and collectible items to trade-in for a freebie have turned into very sophisticated apps and points systems tracking purchases and money spent. These systems have allowed companies to diversify and weigh the rewards they give their shoppers; for example, Harris Teeter has found a way to systemically track what you are buying using your VIC card and offer you coupons for certain items based on past purchases. This information might have only been used to send shoppers promotional coupons and store catalogs in the past, but companies can now use this information to track what people are buying and encourage shoppers to buy more things and spend more money. While gamifying the consumer experience is marketed as a way to make shopping more fun and cost-effective, it comes with harmful side effects to the shopper such as overconsumption and overspending.

<p>
In order to explore the gamification of the consumer experience, it is important to understand how gamification has come to exist in the retail industry. Gamification is defined as “any process that makes use of games or gameful elements to achieve instrumental goals.” This definition is broad, and it is meant to be; to “gamify” is to create “any solution that employs games or ideas/elements from games to solve instrumental needs or problems” (Tondello). The term “gamification” dates back to the digital media industry in 2008. While “gamification” was used to describe the “increasing adoption, institutionalization and ubiquity of (video) games in everyday life,” the term also came to represent a second notion that since video games are entertaining and successful in garnering intense and long-time user engagement, game elements should also be able to make ”other, non-game products and services more enjoyable and engaging as well” (Deterding 9,10). In the consumer market, this meant that businesses began using games to make more profit.
</p>

<p>
Kai Huotari and Juho Hamari consider games systems, noting that games, like systems, are “composed of several interacting sets of mechanisms and actors” and always require “the active involvement of at least one player” (Huotari 22). Huotari and Hamari assert that not all games are inherently successful, and that “gamification can only attempt to support the user in creating gameful experiences that promote the user’s overall value creation” (Huotari 26). Although companies “produce” the game in relation to their own business, consumers are “co-producers” by the fact that a game’s success relies on their interest and engagement. Not everyone likes to play every game, and because the gamification of the consumer experience depends on consumer buy-in, games are developed in an attempt to support, embellish, or enhance the consumer experience using rules, goal-setting, variable outcomes, feedback, and rewards, rather than promote the development of a consumer experience (Huotari 26).
</p>

<p>
Within the gamified experience, researchers from the Labovitz School of Business & Economics at the University of Minnesota Duluth have identified four key experiences a consumer can have; as observers, spectators, apprentices, or performers (McCarthy). The researchers likened the gamified experience to a boxing match; in a boxing match, one can observe by watching from their TVs at home, physically be at the arena and watch the match as a spectator, become a performer by boxing in the match, or become an apprentice and training in hopes of one day becoming a boxer. These four roles can intersect to create different player experiences. For example, when a player is actively absorbed by an experience such as attending a college lecture, the player is an apprentice. When the player passively absorbs an experience, such as watching a movie, they are the observer. When a player passively immerses themselves in an experience like going on a scenic drive they are a spectator. When the player is actively immersed in an experience like playing a sport, the player is a performer with “a measure of control as to how the experience unfolds” (McCarthy 354).

Today, it is easy to label the practice of gamification as “bullshit,” but gamification science still remains “a distinct subdiscipline of game science consisting of researchers adopting a social scientific epistemological footing” (Landers et al.). Game developers have learned to better integrate game elements to real-world processes, and in order to do so have also gained a better understanding of how consumers’ brains work. Many modern programs that gamify the shopping experience emphasize tangible rewards such as points, badges, and leaderboards. By emphasizing tangible rewards, these programs encourage extrinsic motivation, which refers to “doing something because it leads to a separable outcome,” for example being motivated to buy something because of the points or other rewards that come with buying it (Dahlstrøm). By encouraging a player’s extrisitc motivation, these games harm a player’s intrinsic motivation, or desire to pursue an activity simply because it is “inherently interesting or enjoyable.” Why go shopping because one enjoys it when one needs to go shopping in order to derive joy from the points they will acquire from buying something?

<p>
Customers used to have to enter a retailer’s space (visit them in-store or online) in order to actively participate in the shopping experience, but a rise in mobile devices and mobile marketing allows retailers to invert the experience and enter the customer’s personal environment instead by paying for digital ad space on social media platforms and other digital public domains (Hofacker). Unlike traditional marketing, mobile marketing utilizes time to add complexity via real-time engagement, such as sending time-sensitive communications encouraging shoppers to act by a certain time or sending marketing messages at a time of day known for high-interactivity (Krief). Because the world is so digital, companies know that consumers are seeing their messages instantaneously; as a result, consumers are constantly and consistently bombarded with marketing messages 24/7. These marketing tactics bleed into the games that companies develop to further engage shoppers.
</p>

<p>
Because targeting a consumer’s extrinsic motivation has is such a successful marketing tactic, many companies have developed programs that do so, ranging from loyalty apps that give customers points for purchases such as Dunkin’ Donuts to airlines offering points for every mile flown with their specific airline. Oftentimes, these games will encourage brand loyalty by allowing customers to “spend” their points on more of that company’s product—in the case of Dunkin’ Donuts, coffee or food items and, in the case of airlines, seat upgrades and money off of future flights. By encouraging customers to engage in a cycle of spending money, earning points, spending points, and then spending more money in order to earn more points to spend, companies have created a learned pattern that traps customers into perpetually spending money on their goods and services. By encouraging consumers to “win” a game with no ending, businesses know that if they can convince consumers to buy in to their games with enticing enough deals their customer base will continue to grow. Higher stakes services such as credit cards have also gamified and implemented their own rewards programs.
</p>

<p>
In his article Developing a Theory of Gamified Learning: Linking Serious Games and Gamification of Learning, Richard Landers discusses the fact that “gamification is intended to influence a learning-related behavior or attitude” (Landers 763). Encouraging customers to consume high-stakes services for rewards such as lines of credit could have potentially negative consequences for customers who do not have the initial means with which to buy into the system or the knowledge or willpower to keep the game from running away from them. After a company has successfully gotten a customer to buy into their loyalty program, what happens if a customer is unable to dig themselves out of the debt they have assumed in order to gain a credit card’s rewards? High-end and luxury brands are far less likely to use games as a way to entice customers to buy their services because their scarcity, luxury status, and brand association is enough to draw customers. If only low-end brands and companies that make money off of their customers’ lack of money utilize games as a part of the consumer experience, it is because these companies recognize their customers’ lack of desire to spend money and are using games in order to coerce them into spending money they don’t want to spend or, worse, don’t have to begin with.
</p>

In their paper The Ethics of Gamification in a Marketing Context, Andrea Stevenson Thorpe acknowledges how stealthily persuasive business practices work at a cognitive level to persuade customers to buy into gamified shopping experiences as well as “ethical implications” this “potential deception” has on consumers (Thorpe 597). Consumer experiences that are low-rewarding and unenjoyable unless a customer actively participates aren’t fun for shoppers. Furthermore, modern mobile marketing is nowhere near as effective as it can be from a business standpoint despite massive efforts of businesses to market and encourage consumption (Hofacker). By ensuring customers are participating in gamified experiences that are high-reward and fun no matter whether shoppers purchase anything, companies will not only improve the customer experience but encourage higher customer retention rates and garner more business in the process. Thorpe suggests businesses abide by the ‘golden rule’ and ‘disclosure rule’ in order to provide consumers with a better gamified experience; by encouraging game designers to imagine how they would feel if they were the user instead of the designer, game designers will be encouraged to design gamified shopping expereinces with the player’s best interest in mind rather than a company’s profit. Scott Nicholson supports Thorpe’s assertion by also stating that “result from the positive and meaningful benefits for the user” (Nicholson 5). One way to help make user benefits positive and meaningful is by supplying the information necessary to make consumers understand how they can gain points and rewards. Dunkin’ Donuts does this by letting users know they earn a free beverage reward with every 200 points earned; airlines do this by making each mile flown one mile earned for future redemption.

As technology has grown and expanded, so have the systems designed to reward consumers for their business. while scholars assert that the gamification of the consumer experience is, presently, harmful to consumers while benefiting companies, they also assert that these systems can be fixed in order to mutually benefit both consumers and businesses to create a positive game experience for all.
