<h5 class="subheading">Introduction</h5>

<p>
Within the modern economy, employers have a singular goal: make employees as productive as possible. Traditionally, employers have used monetary methods to try and increase worker motivation and productivity, incentives like performance bonuses, stock options, and yearly raises. Over time employers have increasingly used more psychological methods in order to increase the productivity of their workers. Some of these are relatively basic, such as the promise of a promotion or the claim of a higher purpose of one’s work. Many of these incentives have been incorporated and implemented within the process of gamification. Gamification is the practice of incorporating game elements into non-game contexts to influence people’s behavior (Beza 2011). Some of these gamified elements are relatively benign, and even helpful: uber doling out badges for the number of miles driven, encouraging people to run because fake zombies are chasing them, or Duolingo using games to teach people new languages (Pastuh 2020, Gabrielle 2018). 
</p>

<p>
However, some of these “games” can be far more invasive and insidious, such as “rank and yank” systems or flashing red lights when people aren’t moving fast enough at work (Jackson 2021, Gabrielle 2018). These types of games, which I will refer to as survival games, have the potential for significantly negative impacts on the lives of workers. Although they can make them more productive, it also can have significantly negative psychological effects on those same employees. While some authors lump all efforts to gamify workplaces into the same bucket, it is important to distinguish between the type of gamification that is being implemented, and by extension, the impact that those games will have on their workers. Rather than suggesting that all gamification is “exploitationware” (Bogost 2011) a more nuanced approach is necessary to understand the impact of gamification on workplaces. In the case of survival games, the cost to workers outweighs any gains for employers, but other types of gamification can provide real benefits if implemented correctly. 
</p>




<h5 class="subheading">Analysis</h5>

<p>
Gamification is a relatively new term, but the actual process of gamification has been going on for centuries. For example, some 18th century composers incorporated game elements into their compositions, rolling dice to determine the order in which measures were played (Gabrielle 2018). What is new, however, is the incorporation of game elements into the workplace. With the rise of digital technologies, and digital gaming along with them, the concept of gamifying the workplace has garnered increased attention, to the point where scholars are writing books, teaching classes, and holding conferences regarding the topic (Schumpeter 2012, Bogost 2011). The digital age is especially important within the conversation regarding gamification because of the ability of employers to track their employees using technology. Prior to the development of these technologies, employers had to rely on more conventional methods of keeping track of employee productivity, such as daily reports. However, because of the increased accessibility of surveillance technologies, employers are easily able to track how productive their employees are at the micro level. An example of this is the target checkout game, which tells the cashier if they’ve scanned an item quick enough or if they need to move faster. When they’ve finished checking a person out, they receive a score (Kim 2015). 
</p>

<p>
These types of games both track employees and attempt to make them more productive. Although these processes are implemented under the name gamification, companies implement these strategies in an attempt to make their employees more productive, not necessarily to make work a more enjoyable place (Kamasheva 2015). As many of our authors explain, games are often challenging, yet millions of people choose to spend hours each week playing them by choice. Individuals are motivated to participate in these games despite the lack of monetary or other compensation. Instead, the reward for people is mental and psychological; people enjoy playing games, so they do. For employers, the idea of gamification is appealing because it has the potential to tap into these non-monetary motivations to do work, which would make employees more productive despite not being compensated more. The appeal for companies is obvious; find a way to make work more like games, and people will choose to work harder and for longer periods of time. 
</p>

<p>
The gamification of the workplace can and does take place in a variety of ways. The easiest game elements to introduce into the workplace are what are know as points, badges, and leaderboards (Pastuh 2020). These are often the easiest aspects of gamification to implement (Bogost 2011); companies are able to quickly and relatively easily set up systems wherein employees receive points or badges for doing specific tasks. Ride-sharing companies such as Uber and Lyft do this for both their employees and customers (Pastuh 2020). Five rides in a day, that’s a badge. Drive over a hundred miles using their service, there’s another! Uber also allows its drivers to set income targets for themselves, and then send those drivers notifications encouraging them to drive more in order to reach their self-set targets. Leaderboards are also apart of the gamification equation for many companies, but again, can take on various forms. These can be more positive in rewarding a top salesman of the month, or more insidious, such as placing employees in tiered performance categories and firing the bottom 6% of employees each year for not keeping up, as Amazon does (Jackson 2021). 
</p>

<p>
However, Yu-kai Chou points out in his Ted talk, there is much more to gamification then points, badges, and leaderboards, despite those being the most implemented. As he explains, most games have some form of points and other game elements, yet most games are not enjoyable, and people in turn choose not to play them (Chou 2014). Players are drawn to the games they engage with because of a variety of reasons, such as being a part of something greater, being able to exercise their creativity, or experiencing the world that games create (Chou 2014). Although less common, companies use these forms of gamification in their workplaces as well. Microsoft created the Language Quality Game that turned translating software into other languages into a game for their employees (Ryder 2012, Microsoft). Companies like Epic Systems create campus akin to fantasy worlds, complete with slides, train track carpeting and furniture mounted to the ceilings (Ling 2020). These types of gamifications often make work more enjoyable for employees, as they create an environment that is more fun and playful than they otherwise would be. In turn, employees are more motivated to do their work, not because they are being monitored or scored, but because they get greater enjoyment out of it. 
</p>

<p>
Gamification is not without its detractors. Some, such as Ian Bogost, argue that almost all types of gamification imposed on people should be regarded as exploitationware (2011). As he explains, gamification is exploitative because it “replaces real incentives with fictional ones” (2011). In the case of employers implementing points systems and badges rather than giving out bonuses and raises, it is easy to see how this may be the case. Rather than being compensated more for increasing the quantity or quality of one’s work, that person is instead compensated with a fictitious currency that holds no true value. For Bogost, this is a means for companies to exploit their workers' psychology for their own gains. Elsewhere, Bogost has argued that “Gamification is Bullshit” because it conceals the truth using the term Gamification to describe what is in reality a method of coercion (Bogost 2011). Others argue that one requirement of games is that they are voluntary, and workplace gamification rarely is for those who are subjected to it (Spencer 2013). Vincent Gabrielle suggests that gamification can subvert one’s morality, as people may take action because of the reward associated with those acts rather than because they are the right thing to do (2018). 
</p>

<p>
Conversely, other scholars and business leaders see gamification as something that has significant potential to “level up our lives” (Chou 2014). Chou specifically envisions a world wherein people are excited to wake up in the morning because they get to go to work, but instead of it being grueling, they get to have fun every day (Chou 2014). Arguably, Chou fails to recognize major concerns regarding gamification, even when he acknowledges within his own presentation that scarcity and competition can be some of the most effective means within games to motivate people to play. Another author argues that critiques of gamification focus heavily on the imbalance of power and reward between the players and those that create the game, with a particular focus on the arguments made by Bogost (Kim 2018). However, he argues that this imbalance is not enough to merit moral wrongdoing. He argues that in the case of a surgeon charging $35,000 to complete a heart transplant, it would seem wrong to suggest that the person whose life is saved has exploited the surgeon if their life is worth more than $35,000 (Kim 2018). On the same grounds, he argues that the gamification of workplaces cannot then be considered immoral on those grounds.
</p>

<p>
Both sides of this argument fail to recognize the issues within their own case regarding gamification. In the case of gamification in the workplace, it is important to distinguish between survival games and other forms of gamification. Although this term is more commonly used in relation to television shows and literature (Elliot 2018), the distinction between these different types of game elements is essential. These types of games are defined by eliminations, voting people off, or true life and death circumstances. A show like Survivor and Naked and Afraid are obvious examples of this; they strip you down to the bare minimum and force you to try and survive in the middle of the jungle. Shows like the Amazing Race also fit in this category, as contestants are constantly racing against the clock and each other in order to make it into the next round of competition. What makes survival games different from other types of games is that they prey on the fear of those “playing” these games (Elliot 2018). The people within these situations are fearful of being eliminated, and consequently take drastic actions against others in order to prevent their own loss. Often, the elements are so extreme that the reason people enter into these contests is because of the big cash reward if you’re able to survive.
</p>

<p>
What makes these types of games so objectionable within the workplace is twofold. First, these games are not optional for employees. If you work at amazon and they cut 6% of workers every quarter, you do not have the ability to opt out (Jackson 2021). Many philosophers go as far to argue that our current system of wage labor is wage slavery, as people are endlessly stuck in a system wherein they have to work for oppressive employers (Gourevitch 2015). The second objectionable aspect of these survival games is the dynamics that they create within a workplace. If a person is constantly fighting for their survival, then that person is constantly on edge, always looking for a way to get ahead of others in the pecking order, and simply focused on trying to survive. Simply put, this is not a game, it is ostensibly life or death, especially for workers who do not have savings or other forms of income. This is not a game that people can resist, because non-participation means they will not survive. It means loss of income and livelihood. Yet, these types of games are implemented constantly within the workplace. Companies like Amazon fire their lowest rated employees regardless of whether they’re good at their jobs or not (Jackson 2021). Target has a checkout game that tells you with every item you swipe that you need to move faster and can use that data to decide whether to fire you or not (Kim 2018). Disney California flashes red lights at employees when they don’t work fast enough, and for those who don’t skip breaks to catch up there can be dire consequences (Gabrielle 2018). These types of gamification are not games at all, but instead activating people’s need for survival. Although they may make workers more productive, they come with massive psychological costs to those workers and the workplace as a whole. 
</p>

<p>
Outside of these survival games, there are still numerous opportunities for gamification within the workplace that may both improve productivity and increase the enjoyment workers get from their jobs. Microsoft’s Language Quality Game is a great example of this, as they were able to turn an arguably monotonous task into a game that many people within the company enjoy. Gamified environments are another, as they have the potential to make workers want to stay at work longer and find greater enjoyment in being at work. What companies should not be doing is subjecting their employees to survival games that aren’t really games at all. These mechanisms only serve employers and do so at major costs to their employees.
