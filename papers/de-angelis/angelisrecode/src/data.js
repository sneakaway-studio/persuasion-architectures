But, you are able to not get influenced too much by the way others use online platform, and can often decide what to do based on what you believe is best. Aside from the online space, you visit popular places, do activities recommended by many, and follow trends, but not just merely because the majority of people suggest doing so, also if you personally think they are worthy.",

      "Posts, images, videos and products seem less interesting and less valid to you if the number of likes, or similar positive reinforcement, is low. You consider the numbers on different online platform to be the main indication of the quality of the content posted there. You are more likely to engage in activities if you see that many other people, especially if they are your friends or similar to you, are also doing them. Additionally, you would feel lost watching a sitcom without the laugh track, and appreciate shows with a live audience, so that the jokes sound funnier and you get a sense of when it is the right time to laugh. In real life, you think lines outside of stores are a clear symbol of good quality and you always try the new trend if many people around you are recommending it.",
