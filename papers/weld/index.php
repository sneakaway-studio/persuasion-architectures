<p>Addiction is defined to be, “the fact or condition of being addicted to a particular substance, thing, or activity.”  Most people often think of drug or alcohol addictions at first glance, but an even more grueling addiction is that of social media.  In 2019, 1 in 5 teens have been reported abusing prescription medications (Juergens) whereas 1 in 4 teens have been reported to be addicted to social media (McClellan).  </p>

<p>Social media addiction occurs like those of drugs, alcohol, and cigarettes.  The brain operates based off of a “pleasure principle”.  The brain registers all sources of pleasure in the same way, no matter where they originate from.  When the brain experiences pleasure there is a release of the neurotransmitter dopamine, “dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens is so consistently tied with pleasure that neuroscientists refer to the region as the brain's pleasure center”  (Harvard Health). Addictive drugs are a very popular example of something that provides a shortcut to the brain’s reward, or pleasure, system as it floods the nucleus accumbens with dopamine.  Another part of the brain, the hippocampus, stores memories of this intense sense of satisfaction, and the amygdala part of the brain stores the response to this specific stimulus which is why the body knows that it was the drugs that made it feel so good.</p>

<p>This dopamine property of the brain works the same way with all of the “like systems” utilized by most social media platforms.  When an individual receives a “like” on a post, dopamine is released from the brain, and it leaves the individual wanting more.  The brain encourages the individual to post more and thus return to the social media platform as they seek the feeling the dopamine release left them with.  This develops a vicious cycle that can create stress for a user in terms of curating the most interesting content possible to maximize the dopamine “high” per post.  The dopamine effect and “like system” work together and promote users to think about what their followers would like to see most often in their feed.</p>

<p>A lot of time people are not even aware of their social media addiction, which can make it even more dangerous.  There are many negative impacts of too much social media.  One impact a social media addiction can have is the ability to lower decision-making skills.  A study was conducted at Michigan State University which found that people who are reported to spend extended periods of time struggle to make good decisions.  Participants of the study were asked to answer questions about their social media use; the questions were aimed at targeting the individual’s dependence on social media as well as whether or not they felt like they could live without social media ever again.  One way a dependence on social media is seen is through “phantom vibration syndrome”, which is where people think their phone is ringing or vibrating when it's not (Locke).</p>

<p>After the participants concluded the survey, they had to complete a psychological task called the Iowa Gambling Task.  This task helped the researchers better understand the participants’ value-based decision-making skills.  Participants, during the task, are encouraged to collect as much money as possible.  The researchers were able to conclude those who spent more time on social media were more likely to collect the least amount of money at the end of the task.  It was conversely proven that those who spent smaller amounts of time on social media were able to collect larger sums of money upon concluding the task.  This research project is important proof that social media addiction and excessive social media use can lead to poor decision-making.</p>

<p>Being hooked on social media can also be seen to negatively impact communication skills.  For example, people addicted to social media are more likely to interrupt a conversation to check their accounts (Sherri).  This can cause problems in many aspects of an individual’s life; it can translate into their personal life as well as professional career. Some of the negative impacts of social media addiction include: increased anxiety, irritation, or anger when the individual cannot check social media, lying to others about how much time is spent on social media, withdrawing from family and friends, losing interest in other activities, neglecting school or work in favor of social media, and feeling stressed and that an individual’s life is lacking.  It is clear that there are many negative impacts when abusing time spent on social media.</p>

<p>There are a number of negative affects seen in children when they are spending excessive amounts of time on social media as well.  For children, the chances of becoming obese, developing problems going to sleep, and the risk of developing depression, anxiety, and attention problems are all increased when they spend too much time on social media.  According to The Center for Parenting Education, “it’s estimated that kids and teens between the ages of 8 to 28 spend about 44.5 hours each week in front of digital screens” (Clark) and “about 23% of kids and teens have reported that they actually feel as if they have addictions to video games. That breaks down to 31% of males and 13% of female” (Clark).  These statistics and results show that it is dangerous to expose children to social media when the amount of time spent on these platforms is not properly monitored. </p>

<p>Apple offers a special setting in each device to help monitor the amount of time spent using social media applications to help alleviate some of the negative impacts cause by excessive use of these media platforms.  Apple Screen Time, “lets you know how much time you and your kids spend on apps, websites, and more” (Apple Suppot).  iPhone owners (and parents of those children) can use Apple Screen Time to lock off access to certain applications after they are used for a certain amount of time.  The goal of this setting is to eliminate excessive use of social media apps (and other apps that occupy too much time and can be abused). </p>

</p>


<p>In summary, extensive use of social media applications coupled with the chemical makeup of the brain combine to result in social media addiction.  It is important for people to understand the ways spending too much time on social media can negatively impact many different parts of their lives.  The brain acts the same way with social media as it does with any other substance in terms of addiction.  The brain enjoys feedback from “likes” similar to how it enjoys the feeling drugs provide the body; it is all because of the amounts of dopamine released in the brain.  People need to be careful they do not spend too much time using social media otherwise they may begin to suffer from social media addiction. </p>
