<p>While researching persuasion and its connection to economics I discovered a field that is more prominent in using persuasive tactics while remaining true to the underlying economic laws, marketing. My goal in this paper is to use previous research on persuasion methods and their usage as well as economic models developed to predict human behavior to make a profit to analyze its effectiveness throughout history.
</p>

<p>To attain this goal, I have divided the paper into four sections. The first section will discuss the history of persuasion in marketing and how it has evolved throughout the years. More specifically it will focus on the transformation of marketing into the digital age where users can purchase products through the internet avoiding face-to-face interactions. This forces companies to be intuitive and come up with creative ways to market to the public using online platforms. The second section will focus on examples of how individuals could be persuaded in marketing through persuasion tactics and how economic theory could be used to enhance the ability to persuade companies. It will focus on specific economic models that have been created to aid companies to predict human behavior to optimize sales. The third section will analyze the usage of data and how companies oftentimes manipulate data to misinform consumers and persuade them to have an overall optimistic perspective on their product.  The last section will summarize all three sections while mentioning ways on how to avoid or prevent being persuaded by such technologies. </p>

<p>The idea of marketing first came to fruition in the Industrial Revolution. The Industrial revolution is best known for the period between the 18th century and 19th century when a social change occurred due to a rapid increase in innovation led by scientific and technological industries. During this period, purchasing premade goods became the norm instead of creating or inventing goods. This shift in the societal functioning of the economy led big manufactures to come up with ways to inform customers about their products. Due to the increase in competition, producers were forced to develop brands to increase their product market value and sell more. This boom in competition led to an increase in production in all respects in the market that eventually led to manufactures focusing on persuading consumers that their brand was the best (Hardy, 2020). By the 1960s markets in most industries were saturated with competition which prompted companies to develop sophistication and expertise in marketing. This led to the creation of marketing managers who are in charge of all the marketing aspects of a company. Soon enough marketing managers had substantial input in company strategic planning. Marketing managers now help determine costs and find the most effective ways to communicate information about the company’s products and services to consumers. In the 1990s the world of marketing evolved to become more brand focus leading companies to sell more high-quality products and improve their brand. In the late 1990s, Bristol-Myers Squibb became the first company to accomplish online marketing with the usage of a website. Since the creation of the web, marketing had to radically evolve to keep up with the constantly changing world of technology. Search engines invented search engine optimization (SEO) where websites are ranked depending on their good standing and relevancy. If a company tries to manipulate the rankings, they are at risk of becoming censored on the search engine results.  </p>

<p>Ever since the creation of the internet and SEO, companies have had to create ways to engage their customers online. In an effort to replace face-to-face persuasion interactions, companies have to rely heavily on the user experience, more importantly, the user interface. Some companies even higher web designers who inspect every aspect of the website, from the layout of images to the positioning of text (Bacic H., 2013 November 21). According to the website seafoammedia.com, web designers primarily focus on two main components of designing a website and those are the user interface and the user experience. The user interface focuses on providing users a sleek look and feels to the software within the website. Meanwhile, the user experience focuses on, as the name implies, the experience of the user. When focusing on the user experience the designer will aim for a clean interface, the accessibility of the website’s components, and if there is room for improvement. Overall, with the omission of persuasion tactics that would otherwise be used in face-to-face interactions, companies have to emphasize their branding by creating aesthetically pleasing website interfaces that uphold their high-quality branding. </p>

<p>The following HTML file redirects you to an immersive story where the focal point is to understand the persuasion tactics that salespeople would use in face-to-face interactions. The same tactics that have been forgone in the digital age. </p>

<p>As we have seen, marketing has evolved and continues to change as time progresses. Similarly, the fields of the academic world have also evolved prompting educators and researchers to invent new methodologies and technologies. For example, Economic modeling has become widely used that even companies can benefit from them. According to the International Monetary Fund website, an economic model is a simplified interpretation of the world that is created in order to hypothesize behavior. The beauty of an economic model is that they are subjective in nature as their design is completely in the hands of the creator. It is important to note there are two forms of economic models, theoretical and empirical. Theoretical models are used to verify the implications of behavior under the assumption that the given agents maximize their objectives with respect to the constraints found in the model. Meanwhile, empirical models verify qualitative predictions of theoretical models which oftentimes give a precise numerical outcome. A notable model is the Susceptibility to Persuasion-II scale (StP-II) scale that utilizes previously developed scales that stem from social psychology and behavioral economics. A recent study found that StP-II plays a vital part in understanding behavior modification techniques (Modic D, Anderson R, Palomäki J, 2018). With technology like the StP-II scale companies can receive a more precise prediction of whether customers will be easily persuaded or not and can adjust their marketing strategy accordingly. New and creative economic models are constantly being created by manufactories in order to optimize their sales and maximize profit.  For simplicity’s sake, economic modeling is a way to use mathematical theory and logic to theorize solutions for a specific problem. Companies can use economic modeling to their advantage by predicting human behavior. A previous study developed a model to understand persuasion in collective decision-making (Yokoyama, A. 1991). In other words, with the continuing improvements and accuracy of economic models, companies will soon be able to predict your actions and therefore take control of your free will. To explain the potential of economic modeling as a way of predicting human behavior with respect to persuasion, I have created a short story based in a dystopian world where companies have realized the power of the economic theory of persuasion. </p>

<p>Marketing’s main goal is to persuade the individual regardless of the means. Therefore, some companies partake in psychological manipulation in order to effectively persuade you. One way to market your item is to pay the platform you are being hosted on. For example, Facebook and Amazon can both recommend users’ items and they can assure their audience will be perfect for your product by profiling them based on their likes and interests. There are many forms to manipulation an individual but some of the most prominent methods relied on the economic pillar of scarcity. Some examples of this are limited bonuses, special prices, countdown timers, and special day only events (Oldford, S. 2018, May 24). Marketers use psychological tactics to manipulate our senses. Since our unconscious mind processes information without our awareness, marketers can manipulate our senses by creating a real experience based on false illusions (Praet, D. V. 2013, June 3).In other words, they create an unconscious branding of their products that creates an idea of what to expect from them. In an effort to unpack the intricacies of persuasion and the many ways it can be performed; I have included one final interactive story that assigns you with the task of using persuasion to help a friend. </p>

<p>Marketing has expanded immensely since its creation. It now spans the internet as well as the fields of economic theory. The competition within marketing has caused companies to commit unethical actions such as manipulating consumers and creating economic models to predict and control your decision making. The best way to avoid being persuaded by any of the methods described in this paper is to become informed and aware. Some key aspects to focus on are to interrupt the recurring patterns of persuasion, change associations you make with brands, and understand the triggers that cause your decision making.  Once you are more conscientious of your decision making will you be able to understand how companies have already manipulated and persuaded your behavior to act in a specific from in regard to their brands. </p>
