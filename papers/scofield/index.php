// NOTES

// Protest Sim is a game meant to illustrate different types of anti-organization architecture. All of these are based around walls and guard positioning (called pigs in game) and protocols. The goal is to get a set number of protesters into a specific area for a set amount of time. In the game, I try to showcase the following types of architecture and protocol:

// -          Placing a guard in front of an access point
// -          Limiting access points
// -          Guard patrols
// -          Flow control
// -          Redundant fortifications

// Placing a guard in front of an access point is an ancient but effective strategy. If people can’t find a clever way around, they’ll be seen and apprehended. Limiting access points works well with guards. Decreasing the number of access points means fewer guards are needed to cover the area. Patrolling guards further decreases the need to have many guards by allowing one guard to cover a larger area. Flow control is a little more complicated; paths are made thinner and corners are made sharper to slow the traffic through the hallway, road, or corridor and allow enforcement to more easily stop intruders. Redundant fortifications are another classic example of anti-invasion/protest architecture. A popular example of this would be Minas Tirith from The Lord of the Rings. This city is built as a series of semicircles with gates on alternating ends. This means that intruders have to pass through the entire tier in order to reach the gate for the next, since having multiple walls will stop more intruders than just one. This is also a good example of flow control and limiting access points.

// By illustrating abstract examples of this architecture, I hope to enlighten players of its purpose and allow them to identify it in their surroundings. Architecture is a powerful tool for control, but understanding and identifying something is the first step to overcoming it or improving it.

<h5 class="subheading">Introduction</h5>


<p>
Dynamics of control aren’t purely sociological; they have physical footprints. These architectures of control are obvious in places like prisons or zoos, where there is a clear power hierarchy, but they exist almost everywhere. Schools, hospitals, cities, and other public spaces are all designed and built with considerations of quelling dissent and suppressing danger. 
</p>

<p>
These systems have digital footprints as well. Nearly every application has security protocols. Technology allows people to communicate almost instantaneously, which is both invaluable and dangerous to those in power. It helps things run efficiently, but can be used to spread information they may rather keep hidden.
</p>

<p>
While security is crucial for safety and comfort, it can be easily turned inward and against innocent people. Walls built to protect can exclude or restrain. It seems like a necessary tradeoff, and there are some penalties that are unavoidable; locking a door sacrifices convenience for security, for example. However, there are some affordances we make that we don’t need to. Defense against violence does not require that we open ourselves to violence on two fronts. Fending off invaders should not prevent us from accepting people into our nation. Website moderation systems are most often used to stop illegal or harmful activity, but it can also be used to silence discussion on a certain topic or organization around a certain cause.
</p>

<p>
The physical manifestations of unfair power dynamics impact us daily. Funding for public resources is low, but those with personal wealth can build whatever they want or need. Walls keep us out, lack of transportation slows us down, and the offices high overhead remind us just how vast the gaps between the wealthy and ordinary people are.
</p>




<h5 class="subheading">A Culture of Discipline and Dynamics</h5>


<p>
Our society is built on discipline. Natural consequences are often seen as insufficient, and we need to artificially reinforce desired behavior. As prisons are one of the most powerful and widely used tools available for negative reinforcement, looking at their architecture may give us some idea of how the design of other spaces can impact our perception of power dynamics and the threat of discipline.
</p>

<p>
In Foucault’s Discipline and Punishment, he discusses Bentham’s panopticon. The panopticon is possibly the ultimate symbol of a toxic power dynamic. The prisoners, which, as Foucault points out, could be madmen, workers, or schoolchildren, are isolated and visible like solitary actors on a stage. The central tower rises high above the prisoners’ cells. Its phallic form dominates the prison, acting like a mask of unfaltering power. Not only is there a physical hierarchy in the height, shape, and size of the tower, but an informational one as well. The prisoners are fully seen by the guard in the tower; everything but their thoughts can be easily observed and punished, if need be. But the guard remains unseen. There doesn’t even need to be a guard for this to work. It could be a camera, a dummy, or just empty space. The prisoners will never know any different (Foucault).
</p>

<p>
Surveillance is the next step in defensive and oppressive architecture after the wall. Walls are steadfast and immovable, but surveillance is highly adaptable. Surveillance can be used for dissuasion, just like a wall, but it adds the ability to reward what’s deemed positive behavior and to punish any negative ones. Loyal customers may get discounts and people trying to circumvent censors may end up in prison. Used in tandem with a barrier, like in the panopticon, it can be a powerful tool of prevention and discipline.
</p>

<p>
Designs including power dynamics, like the panopticon, exist almost everywhere. Imagine a theater. There is an audience section, likely partitioned and tiered, and a stage. The common people sit in the central section, under the actors, but the more VIP guests will likely have a private balcony, high above the stage. While the actors are more highly prized than the bulk of the audience due to their talent and skill, they are still commodified and objectified by those above. In their interview with Bloomberg, Natascha Meuser talks about the architecture and evolution of zoos. Zoos serve many different functions nowadays but started off closer to what we’d think of as a circus. People would walk past cages full of animals and then move on to the next. Since the zoo runners didn’t really understand these animals, keeping them in a small cage was the only way they knew to care for them. Now, zoos are there to help raise awareness, to entertain people, to study animals, and to provide a healthy and safe environment for the animals (Moore). Some zoos achieve these goals better than others. Sometimes, zoos can have a similar structure to a theater, except the stage is typically lower than the audience for safety purposes. The environment this creates is one of control and objectification, however. We underestimate how important height is for our perception of importance. Since the animals are lower than us, and on a stage-like structure that maybe even has some painted backgrounds and false plants, we begin to see them as objects, toys for our entertainment. This echoes the attitudes towards actors on a stage; we may respect them, but, at the end of the day, they are a commodity only there for our enjoyment.

<h5 class="subheading">Architectures of Control</h5>

<p>
Oppressive architecture can affect the ability and willingness of people to organize, infiltrate, or overthrow by creating an image of authority and immutability. Throughout history, walls, chokepoints, and guard posts have limited the mobility of the lower classes, protecting the upper class that built them. In modern times, we have new features that less explicitly perform the same functions. Guards and walls still exist, but now we have security cameras, bunkers, submarines, and countless other ways to emulate walls and moats. At its base, the goal of these architectures is to put a physical barrier between the upper and lower classes to preserve current power structures. The one advantage the lower classes have against the upper classes is numbers. By physically stopping the lower classes from entering their territory, they are able to keep themselves from being overrun and overthrown. 
</p>


<h5 class="subheading">Digital Architectures</h5>

<p>
These structures are echoed in our virtual architecture. Firewalls, online surveillance, and intentional web design can serve a similar function. Like the panopticon, these are used in tandem. A firewall can prevent access to illegal materials, but, if the attempt is not logged, the offender can simply try again until they find a pathway to what they want. If the system keeps track of these attempts, punishment can be doled out to dissuade future attempts. ISPs, at least in the United States, do just this. Every connection made and packet sent is logged and reviewed. On one hand, this helps crack down on terrible things that can be done through the internet like human trafficking, money laundering, immoral pornography, and much more. However, it, like all the other examples I’ve discussed, can be turned on innocent people. If a person tries to access censored news information, hidden from them by an oppressive government, they can be imprisoned or worse.
</p>

<h5 class="subheading">Secure != Free</h5>

<p>
Security is important; it prevents unnecessary violence and damage. However, it’s a double-edged sword. The same security measures that keep people safe from those who would harm them prevent them from being heard by those in power.
</p>

<p>
In his article for MOA Architecture, Mousseau discusses the architectures of school security. In the wake of tragedies like Sandy Hook or Columbine, school security is extremely important. Mousseau claims that architects and designers center their approaches to security around four elements: “Deterrence, Detection, Delay and Response” (Mousseau). Deterrence, detection, and delay all have physical manifestations. Fences and walls will deter an action. Detection devices, like security cameras or guards, will not only help with quick responses but act as deterrence devices themselves. Delaying can be as simple as locking a door; even seconds can prevent tragedy. The problem, however, is that these designs can be aimed wherever those who built them and have the keys want. In an instant, walls meant to keep bad guys out can keep students inside. Cameras meant to identify criminals can identify the potential of student-led social organization and protest. Those in power may treat these threats to their power with the same force they would treat a violent threat against the students and themselves.
</p>

<p>
Online censorship prevents access to scarring and immoral things like grotesque violence or illegal pornography. However, censorship can harm us by stopping us from seeing important information about social movements, communicating with others, and uncovering information that those in power would rather stay hidden. Corrupt and powerful people’s only weakness is the dissemination of information; if news of their dealings gets out, other individuals won’t continue to do business with them and their image and power will falter.
</p>
      	
<p>
The double-edged sword of security remains a threat to freedom of organization and expression, and, unless restraints are put in place that will prevent abuse of these systems, they will continue to be used against those hoping to enact social change and real threats indeterminately.
</p>




<h5 class="subheading">Conclusions</h5>

<p>
Physical architecture’s role in maintaining existing power structures and dynamics is largely unchanged from the introduction of castle walls. Our digital architecture works in much the same ways as these age-old structures. The power of architecture is undeniable; it shapes the way we live our lives and the perspectives we hold of our society and our place in it. Walls can keep us out, and digital eyes follow us everywhere we go. While security is a necessary aspect of life, the same tools used to protect us are used to hold us back. Social movements are crucial to maintaining a balance of power in the world, but having the things that keep us safe aimed at preventing change can dissuade and weaken organization. Understanding the architectures used to control and reinforce is the first step towards change.
