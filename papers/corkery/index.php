The topic of online surveillance has never bothered me too much. I've always had the sentiment that there are so many other people online and I don't have anything to hide, so it's not a big deal. Every so often a targeted ad would appear on some social media though and it would just feel too targeted. It is uncomfortable not knowing how someone has information on you, especially if it feels like its being done secretly. As I became aware of how data is sold and shared between companies, I actually felt more comfortable with targeted content because at least I knew how my data was being collected.

However, the amount of impact these systems that produce targeted content have on their users can cause big issues and affect lots of people. If people are only receiving content and media from sources they are most likely to agree with, the risk of mass misinformation and radical ideals increases heavily. The focus of my game center’s around this, and specifically touches on the real world impacts that popular platforms can cause with their targeted content.

As I developed the game, I got more and more into the actual game development and using JavaScript to customize, so it’s definitely supposed to feel more like a traditional game than usual Twine games, as I ended up completely venturing outside Twine. We had talked earlier in the year about gamification and how it’s used to make certain tasks or work more fun, to hide how terrible the work actually is. I decided to connect the idea of gamification with my project by designing simple or well-known games that have a theme around the damages these different platforms can cause. But the game does not feel serious or dark, rather it’s makes the theme fun, which is why targeted content is typically accepted because it provides the user with some sort of benefit to hide anything problematic.

It was frustrating to make this game at times because the bugs started to take forever to fix once I started using languages and tools I had not used before. But it was very enjoyable exploring the many different things I could do to design my game. If I had more time, I would have added more apps/games but for now there are three to play.




Below is my gameplay video. There's no audio but it's pretty self-explanatory. -->
