<h5 class="subheading">Introduction</h5>

<p>Throughout the pandemic, two important trends have changed the landscape of American neighborhoods: a much higher proportion of Americans work from home, and rates of violent crime have skyrocketed (Lopez; Parker). These trends influence many Americans' proximity to public safety issues in their neighborhood, and perceptions of crime in the country at large. In many neighborhoods, citizens have taken the responsibility of surveillance into their own hands using new technologies.</p>

<p>For example, in Westgate, a neighborhood in Columbus, Ohio, if an unrecognizable figure walks down the street, every neighbor would likely know of the “intrusion” within minutes. Residents often rely on a private neighborhood Facebook group to address crime and public safety issues, with 678 members as of June 2021. One neighbor, Kelly McKinney, claimed that “nobody can leave…or come into our neighborhood without us knowing exactly how…” Westgate neighbors use digital tools to collaboratively track and report: as of last year, around 200 homes in Westgate owned surveillance cameras, and the neighborhood has formed a close relationship with the police and city to report all emergency and non-emergency complaints. (Downing)</p>

<p>Westgate’s story exemplifies a broader phenomenon, in which high-resourced communities feel persuaded to use -- and can easily access-- technologies that create hyper-surveilled communities. Scholar Mark Andrejevic has coined the term “lateral surveillance,” which is “not the top-down monitoring of employees by employers, citizens by the state, but rather the peer-to-peer surveillance of spouses, friends, and relatives.” (Andrejevic) Another researcher, Gary Marx found that lateral surveillance platforms often have ambiguous and contradictory effects: in many cases, they can strengthen a community’s social fabric, but they can also uphold a long history of exclusivity and policing in largely white, wealthy neighborhoods, and heighten paranoia. (Marx) This paper attempts to address some of the complex systems that persuade those individuals to participate in surveillance: from the state encouraging citizen participation in surveillance; to the private actors selling technologies; to the (often wealthy and white) communities that create buy-in by promoting exclusivity.
</p>


<h5 class="subheading">Public</h5>

<p>Citizen participation in state surveillance and policing has a long history in North America. Before the institutionalization of public police, individuals would participate in a system of informally watching their communities for safety. Today, however, most crime prevention relies on reporting incidents to local authorities. Marx also observes that “[s]tate retrenchment in the provision of services… and new security, crime, and other risks… along with the appearance of new technologies for communication and analysis, have led to increased appeals by police to citizens for help.” (Marx)</p>

<p>The Neighborhood Watch program is one of the earliest examples of the state persuading private citizens to participate in surveillance. The National Sherriff’s Association created Neighborhood Watch during the 1960s, after disinvestment in cities and white flight created a perceived “urban crisis” and high rates of crime. (Snodgrass) The Neighborhood Watch program drew on findings from the Chicago School of urban sociology, which blamed high rates of crime in certain neighborhoods on “social disorganization,” which arose from neighborhoods with heterogeneous socioeconomic and ethnic makeup, high population turnover, transience, and more. (Sugrue) Due to an “erosion of shared norms” in these areas, urban sociologists posited that in addition to official law enforcement, voluntary informal control from residents themselves would “maintain standards of behavior” to discourage crime. (“Our History”) The Neighborhood Watch program, and other police-community initiatives not only lighten the police’s load, but also improve their image and relationships with the communities they serve. (Purenne)</p>

<p>On a larger scale, the federal government has called upon citizens across the country to participate in surveilling issues of national importance. After 9/11, the government promoted a “vigilant mindset” within citizens, asking them to keep an eye out for the next potential terrorist act. (Reeves) The U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) “If You See Something, Say Something,” which began in 2010, called on citizens to participate in surveillance of terrorism. DHS began the campaign in sports stadiums, hotels, transportation departments, airports, and Walmart. (Reeves) Thus, Andrejevic points out, “[t]he participatory injunction of the interactive revolution extends monitoring techniques from the cloistered offices of the Pentagon to the everyday spaces of our homes and offices…” (Andrejevic) Public institutions have a vested interest in promoting citizens’ involvement in surveillance.</p>



<h5 class="subheading">Private</h5>

<p>The private sector, for the most part, plays the role of producing the tools that make surveillance possible, sacrificing citizens’ safety and personal freedoms for the sake of profit. Andrejevic observes, “part of the promise of the interactive, information revolution is to provide the general public with access to the means of surveillance for do-it-yourself use in the privacy of one’s home.” (Andrejevic) Several private technologies capture the media’s attention for their growing pervasiveness, lack of guardrails, and overwhelmingly negative consequences.</p>



<h5 class="subheading">Nextdoor</h5>

<p>A well-known lateral surveillance platform is the app Nextdoor, although surveillance is not the app’s primary mission. Nextdoor’s founder, Nirav Tolia describes Nextdoor “as a place to find a babysitter, a plumber, or a missing cat,” and as of 2021, the app was valued at over $2 billion. (Medina) Nextdoor is a “place-based community networking” platform, but has come under fire for encouraging surveillance, paranoia, racial profiling, and exclusivity. Nextdoor networks are created when a “Founding Member” logs into the app and invites other households to join, and “[o]nce launched, members share information about local activities that range from yard sales to upcoming street repairs, but more often than not descend into a security politics of neighborhood watch activities, without any regard to the actual presence of crime or observed criminality.” (Bloch) As both a social media network and crime reporting service, Nextdoor lacks guardrails necessary to prevent individuals’ prejudices from reaching large audiences.</p>

<p>In Oakland, for example, many white neighbors reported innocent Black or Latinx people in their neighborhood as suspicious. One resident observed, “‘There is this automatic fear or suspicion of anyone different, and it was validated by all these neighbors…It was like the bias was so insidious, and somehow the online community allows them to say what they have been thinking all along but not saying.’” (Medina) Furthermore, Nextdoor uses “community moderators,” creating an oppressive system in which people of diverse political ideologies are occasionally removed from the network. The people who moderate the social network are not paid, independent people who Nextdoor hires. Rather, the system is “self-governed” with “community leads” -- whoever launches the Nextdoor network for their neighborhood is the person who moderates the space. Nextdoor’s “hands-off approach” to moderation has allowed the app to spread so quickly, but it also gives some community members the ability to remove posts or accounts they personally disagree with. For example, in numerous cases, people who support Black Lives Matter have been removed from Nextdoor by moderators who do not support the movement, despite not violating any of the app’s rules. Because of its inherent structural issues, Nextdoor can fuel discrimination.</p>




<h5 class="subheading">Amazon Ring and Neighbors</h5>

<p>Ring cameras, an Amazon product intended for homeowners, have resulted in “the largest corporate-owned, civilian-installed surveillance network that the US has ever seen.” The Ring is a doorbell with a built-in camera for homeowners to monitor activity in their neighborhood. Ring’s capabilities to collaborate with law enforcement are particularly alarming: “once Ring users agree to release video content to law enforcement, there is no way to revoke access and few limitations on how that content can be used, stored, and with whom it can be shared.” Since 2018, Amazon has since created relationships with over 1,800 local law enforcement agencies who can ask for Ring footage without warrants. As of May 2021, one in ten police departments had access to videos from millions of the cameras. </p>

<p>The cameras also pair with an accompanying crime reporting app from Amazon called “Neighbors,” which encourages Ring owners to upload footage to appraise fellow neighbors and law enforcement of crimes. Users can see crime or emergency reports within a five-mile radius of their home (Figure 4). Vice researchers found that “[v]ideo posts on Neighbors disproportionately depict people of color, and descriptions often use racist language or make racist assumptions about the people shown.” Gathering data from over 100 posts, Vice found that the majority of reports were about Black or brown people, and 75 percent of crimes reported were for stolen packages. On the app, it is not difficult to locate posts reporting “suspicious” figures with baseless claims (Figure 5).

<h5 class="subheading">Citizen</h5>

<p>The company sp0n, Inc. created the app Citizen, which alerts people to nearby crimes using information taken from recent 911 calls. The app purports to provide information faster than AMBER alerts, and also participates in COVID-19 contact tracing. With the ability to collect citizens’ recordings from multiple angles, sp0n has promoted the app as a way of monitoring cases of police brutality. Many find, however, that the app results in over-policing of certain areas, a social network for often stereotypical and racist comments, and creates paranoia even in safe neighborhoods. </p>


Citizen, compared with the other apps discussed in this paper, also seems to encourage a morbid curiosity with the spectacle of crime. In the past, private citizens found ways to listen to emergency police broadcasts with hardware scanners, an activity enjoyed by many curious hobbyists. Today, Citizen “is devoting resources to converting raw scanner traffic — which is by nature unvetted and mostly operational — into filtered curated digital content, legible to regular people, rendered on a map in a far more digestible form.” App users are also encouraged to photograph, record videos, and upload information about dangerous events. A growing number of users seek out the sites of emergency to live stream and garner as many views and comments as they can (Figure 6). Other users are more cautiously optimistic, expressing the sentiment, “I don’t know if I want to know, but I can’t not know. In any case, it’s free, it’s right there, and it’s always refreshed.” Although users do not feel fulfilled by engaging with the content, they cannot turn away.

<h5 class="subheading">Private-Public Collaboration</h5>

<p>Importantly, the private sector forges partnerships with public institutions to disseminate their technologies. Data scientists constructed the “Atlas of Surveillance,” an online database of police departments’ use of various surveillance technologies. The list includes automated license plate readers, body-worn cameras, camera registries, cell-site simulators, drones, face recognition, fusion centers, gunshot detection, predictive policing, real-time crime centers, partnership with Ring, and video analytics (Figure 1). In Davidson, North Carolina, the Atlas shows that the Davidson Police Department began wearing body cameras in 2014 (Figure 2). The department also signed an agreement with Ring in 2019 to gain access to the company’s app, Neighbors. Although the private sector maintains its own unique role in persuading citizens to surveil, its collaboration with public institutions plays a large role in the implementation of lateral surveillance.</p>

<h5 class="subheading">Community</h5>

<p>Researchers have found that lateral surveillance platforms become a way for communities to solidify exclusivity. For example, sociologist Rahim Kurwa argues that Nextdoor creates “digitally gated communities” by upholding racial and economic segregation. Kurwa explains, “the contemporary mode of segregation employed by citizens on Nextdoor is quasi-carceral—by re-articulating racial difference as criminality and threat, participants may police and (attempt to) push out Black residents (including by calling police) without ever explicitly saying they do not wish to live with them.” By using lateral surveillance platforms for carceral practices, communities reinforce segregation and exclusivity.</p>

<p>The persuasion of lateral surveillance not only harms community members deemed suspicious, but also the community members enacting the surveilling. Marx explains, “In regarding each other laterally, the citizen becomes both an agent of and a subject for surveillance. This involves looking carefully at others and perhaps feeling a bit paranoid or at least uncomfortable, knowing others are looking right back.” In the case of the app Citizen, users also felt morbidly curious in witnessing crime, often to their detriment.
</p>






<h5 class="subheading">Resistance</h5>

<p>Ideally, technologically-savvy, hyper-connected communities like Westgate can channel their civic involvement towards positive movements, and less unjust policing of fellow citizens. Interestingly, Marx found that in addition to the recent rise of lateral surveillance, there was a “strengthening of civil society resources and institutions that parallel and supplement the limited resources of the state. Citizens acting independently can serve as a check on, and alternative to, the state and other large organizations, through decentralized, crowd-sourced, and other uses of the Internet.” Perhaps the strength behind these citizens’ initiatives can be redirected to challenge those in power.</p>




<h5 class="subheading">Conclusion</h5>

<p>Few things are more persuasive than an immediate concern with safety, particularly when it’s close to home. In recent years, the convergence of public, private, and civic concerns in the realm of public safety has created an explosion of lateral surveillance platforms. Andrejevic explains an ironic feature of lateral surveillance: “Rather than displacing ‘top-down’ forms of monitoring, such practices emulate and amplify them, fostering the internalization of government strategies and their deployment in the private sphere. In an age in which everyone is to be considered potentially suspect, all are simultaneously urged to become spies.” This research attempted to untangle the relationship between each key actor in the production of lateral surveillance and the alarming consequences.</p>

300–600 word written statement about the game. 

“Just Next Door” is an interactive fiction Twine game that explores neighborhood exclusion, surveillance, and persuasion. The main character is an unnamed person who has recently moved to the town of Davidson. Numerous forces persuade the neighbor to believe that they should participate in surveillance in their neighborhood, despite not having enough information to make conclusions about the “suspicious” activity occurring. 

They are persuaded by a wide range of sources: the media creates a perception that crime rates are high and can only be solved with policing and punishment; the state encourages citizen participation in surveillance; private companies persuade citizens that they need surveillance technologies; and communities encourage participation in exclusive networks of surveillance to feel like connected members of a social group. 

Throughout the game, the players’ choice to participate in surveillance alters the main characters’ emotions, which are measured quantitatively. Different choices in the game can heighten the characters’ feeling of community connectedness, paranoia, or curiosity towards crime. Ultimately, however, the main character’s paranoia becomes the reigning decision-making force, and their life in Davidson spirals towards chaos as a result. The game emphasizes the harm not only on surveilled people, but also on the people practicing surveilling-- which can heighten paranoia, anxiety, and disconnectedness.

The game is titled “Just Next Door” as a spin-off of the neighborhood social networking app, Nextdoor. While the app Nextdoor’s name suggests that neighbors can feel connected to people across the neighborhood (as if they are just next door), the app often actually exposes deep racial, political, economic, and social divisions within a neighborhood. The title “Just Next Door” parodies the notion that Nextdoor or similar technologies accomplish community connectedness, and also previews the game’s eerie vibe.
