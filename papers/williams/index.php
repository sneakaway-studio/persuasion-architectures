            <h5 class="subheading">An Introduction</h5>

            <p>Advertising is all around us.  Everywhere we look we see some girl plastered on a billboard trying to sell us a videogame.  We see a bunch of guys hitting golf balls off the roof of a building and then going to drink beer.  These all play to our emotions.  We see ads and they make us feel some sort of way, whether it is angry at cigarette makers for letting such a dangerous product be around for so long or sad for the dogs we see in humane society commercials. But one emotion seems to be significantly stronger than others.  That emotion is fear. We see it manifested in many different ways, from cigarette ads showing what could happen if you smoke, to the ads for doorbells that aim to keep your house safer, fear is everywhere.  It is a powerful motivator and one of the strongest human emotions.  Fear keeps us moving, it keeps us thinking and the goal of this analysis will be to show that fear along with other emotions keeps us buying.  Most of the U.S. economy is driven by consumer spending.  If we slow our spending, the economy slows. It is the job of advertisers and manufacturers to keep us from saving our money and to keep lining their pockets and the pockets of the economy with more money.</p>

            <p>Print ads used to be the biggest and most lucrative part of advertising, now we see that television ads and ads on social networks are the bread and butter of advertising.  This poses some interesting concerns.  There is a target demographic when creating an ad. Different generations of people view ads very differently.  Like the Thompson article we read for class states: “whereas younger consumers prefer emotional ads for "hedonic" products (beer and cologne) and fact-based ads for "utilitarian" products (pain relievers and investment plans), older consumers prefer effective ads for just about everything.” This is something that advertisers constantly take into account.  There is so much psychology in advertising, the biggest challenge is breaking it all down to create the most effective ad possible.</p>

            <h5 class="subheading">A History</h5>

            <p>The first examples of advertising that have been recorded were in ancient Egypt.  Around 2000bc, it is said that the Egyptians used steel and papyrus to advertise anything from messages from the Pharaoh to other events that would be happening around the kingdom.  </p>

            <p>The Greeks also used advertising to their advantage.  There are stories that women used to tap nails into their shoes to create jingles to let men know that their brothels were open for business.  It also arouses the senses to hear a nice tune, it makes you curious.  The senses have always been an important part of advertising.  Some elicit fear, some happiness, and others, different emotions.  The best advertising is advertising that sticks with you when it is no longer around to be consumed. We know of some ads, however, because they stick around long after the people who have created them are gone.  </p>

            <p>“The Romans certainly knew how to make a convincing sales pitch, and early examples of advertising were found in the ruins of Pompeii” (Yilmaz, 10).  The advertising of old relied on people remembering a jingle for a certain brothel, or a man teaching his son how to read and write so that he could make multiple copies of a specific advertisement so that it could be posted throughout a city.  </p>

            <p>The printing press greatly evolved advertising.  This made mass production of anything printed possible.  In history, we see the number of books skyrocket.  With that, people were also able to mass-produce advertisements.  In 1472, we see the first instance of an advertisement printed on a piece of paper and distributed amongst a large number of people.  This ad was for the sale of prayer books.  </p>

            <p>Print advertising would be used for the next few centuries to advertise everything from joining the war movement to toothpaste and fancy wristwatches.  Where we move on to the main subject of this paper is in 1955.  This year is the first known instance of psychologists getting involved in the business of advertising.  Their goal in understanding the human mind was to decipher humans’ core wants and needs and to understand how their emotions could be used to advertise products to specific types of individuals.  </p>

            <h5 class="subheading">Getting Psychological</h5>

            <p>Ever since people started to understand the human mind, they have been trying to figure out a way to monetize it.  1955 was the first year that psychologists entered the world of advertising, and it would forever change the movement.  Psychologists now know that the hardness of a bench at a McDonalds makes it less comfortable and therefore people are less likely to sit, and converse and they can move more customers through the restaurant. Then there is the psychology of color.  This is everything from “purple makes people think so never paint a room purple” to “bright colors like yellow often make people happy.” (Ciotti) </p>

            <p>“In the 1970’s, people were exposed to about 500 ads per day. At present, people see roughly 5,000 ads per day. There are 5.3 trillion display ads shown online every year. On average, children see 20,000 thirty-second commercials each year. Adults see an average of 2 million of those on a yearly basis.” (USC) These are massive numbers and psychology plays a role in all of these different types of ads.  Radio ads must focus on sound because you only hear them.  Print ads must focus on visuals because you cannot hear them, and video ads are quite possibly the most difficult of them all because they rely on almost all of a person’s senses and they can be the most psychological.  There is nothing like turning on the tv to see an ad of a solider coming home to his family or his dog that was sponsored by a specific brand.  That brand sticks with you because it grabbed a specific emotion that you now associate with that product.</p>

            <p>There are two main types of content in an advertisement.  The first one we will look at is rational content.  This content is specifically numbers or facts.  These do not necessarily play to an emotion except maybe a wow factor.  We often see these types of ads for technological products like a new iPhone and how it has a better camera than a Samsung phone.  A computer might have a 30% better graphics response than the last model.  </p>

            <p>The second main type of psychological content is emotional.  These ads, like their name, play to our emotions, whatever that emotion may be.   These are generally more personal and can include stories of how someone quit smoking or how a car saved the life of their child.  One ad that I remember is a Pedigree ad.  The ad starts with a little girl who is a cancer patient.  The doctor walks into the room and says something along the lines of “we’re going to try a different treatment today” and then in prances a beautiful golden retriever and her face lights up and she says “puppy”.  This commercial immediately struck a chord with me.  It also hits on a couple of different things about the brand.  They are giving back to communities and children, but they are also a great food for dogs.  They never even showed the product which I also think makes the commercial more powerful.</p>

            <p>One of the most powerful human emotions is fear.  Fear is an evolutionary emotion that was designed to keep us safe.  It is used constantly in advertising.  The next section in this paper will dive into this fear and ways that we can combat it, along with different examples.  </p>

            <h5 class="subheading">Shutting Out Fear</h5>

            <p>“Only 2 seats left at this price!” “Book now and save 20%!”  These are the types of ads you see when booking everything from concert tickets to hotel rooms.  This is a very simple type of fear that is constantly used in advertising.  The fear of missing out is the most powerful form of fear in the digital world.  What if I miss out on the last pair of shoes? What if my flight home doubles in price? Some of these are real fears, and many people give in to them.  Partly because advertisers know that fear is such a powerful emotion.  </p>

            <p>Airlines and hotels are incredibly aggressive when it comes to using fear to advertise.  Often when you go on a website like booking.com and search for a hotel room you will see a message along the lines of “50 people are looking at this room for the same dates.” This can drive someone to make a purchase without doing all of the other necessary research because they are afraid to miss out on a room or a specific price. (Yonchev) Airlines do it too.  They are much sneakier about it, however.  Just taking a look at American Airlines’ website, I search for a flight home to Miami from Charlotte.  I see that the round-trip price for my dates is something like $300.  I also see that it says, “Only 2 seats left at this price”.  Because I fly so much, I know that this is actually true.  There are different fare codes for airline tickets, and they all have different prices.  I have also flown enough to know when the best time to buy a flight is.  However, most people don’t know this, and airlines can often rope them into buying a more expensive ticket.  </p>

            <p>There are some sections of advertising though, that have gone from positive to negative in their approach.  The first one that comes to mind is cigarettes.  Looking back at old cigarette advertisements, you see doctors saying that they are good for your health.  Imagine now, in the world we live in today if someone said that cigarettes are good for your health! Lucky Strike had a print ad that ran in 1929, it said: “Light a Lucky and you’ll never miss sweets that make you fat.” About 8 years later, Lucky Strike advertised that cigarettes actually protected your throat, showing a picture of someone signing on the radio.  </p>

            <p>As time went on, cancer started to pop up.  People were getting throat and lung cancer.  As more and more research went into the causes of this cancer, doctors and scientists were able to directly link cigarettes to these types of cancer.  It is also a commonly known fact now that cigarettes cause high blood pressure and bad gums along with the potential risk of cancer.  Over time we saw a shift in advertising for cigarettes.  People started to come out and directly say that cigarettes and tobacco were bad for your health.  In 1971, the government dealt the biggest blow and banned their advertisement on tv and radio.  Now the FDA has the power to regulate the big tobacco companies and instead of seeing ads that these things are good for your health, we are seeing ads that they truly are bad.</p>

            <p>Tobacco Free Florida is an initiative set up by the state of Florida to help spread the word about the harms of smoking. (TFF) They often show commercials of people who used to be smokers and what they look like now and it is often harrowing.  They use the human emotion of fear to “scare people out of buying tobacco products”.  This is a good use of fear, but as stated above there are also bad uses of fear, and we as consumers are finally starting to figure out ways to resist certain types of fear in advertising. </p>

            <h5 class="subheading">Resistance</h5>

            <p>Resistance to fear in advertising is difficult.  After all, advertisers have a lot more understanding of how our brains work than we might.  They also have massive amounts of data that they can pull from to make decisions that we as the public may not have access to.  Knowing your privacy rights is a completely different concern but it is worth looking into.  </p>

            <p>One of the best ways to combat the fear used in advertising is to do your homework.  If you are going to go on a trip and know that you need to book a flight and a hotel, do some research.  Look into how flight and hotel pricing works.  As you get closer, prices fluctuate more so be aware and do not be fearful.  It is also important that when you make a decision to purchase something that you should be confident in the work you have put in prior to making that decision.  </p>

            <p>Some of the biggest resistance to fear in advertising is coming from other companies themselves.  Oliver Yonchev writes: “Marketers who put happiness at the forefront of their decision-making will win the hearts and minds of this generation.” We are a generation that does not really know war or economic hardship.  We know fun and happiness, and Yonchev argues that advertisers who use these emotions are more likely to see us buying their products.  When was the last time you saw a Disney ad that made you angry? When was the last time that you saw a Nike ad that made you want to feel lazy? Resistance to fear in advertising is in its fledgling stages but it will continue to grow as our generation becomes larger and larger consumers. </p>





            <h5 class="subheading">Wrapping Up</h5>

            <p>From carvings on the walls of caves to Instagram stories for beauty products, advertising has been around as long as there have been products to sell.  Though psychology has only come along recently in the relatively long timeline of advertising, it has changed the way that we look at products.  Through emotion, we can be driven towards or away from something.  Through fear, we can make impulse decisions that often work out in a companies’ favor rather than our own. It is important to take in the advertisements we see and how they are created, what emotions do they play on? What can we learn from the way that advertisers use the time that we so freely give them?  </p>
