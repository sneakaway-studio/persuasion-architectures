<p>In her book, Deadly Persuasion, Jean Kilbourne writes, “Advertising works best precisely because we don’t think it works on us” (12). In a time when human interactions have transitioned entirely online, this quote rings true now more than ever. Businesses are making significant changes that rely on the media to transmit new information and facilitate engagement through online purchases. Although we, as consumers, believe pressing delete or continuing to scroll keeps us immune to the overflow of advertisements through our screens and inboxes, our engagement with new content has an opposite effect. In fact, with every click or scroll, we make ourselves more susceptible to the irresistible lure of advertisements. Why should we believe we can tune out information that is designed to specifically combat the “tuning out” process? Our stubbornness and ignorance to admit the media’s influence on our lives leads us to subconsciously fall victim to the never-ending lure of persuasion in advertisements. This unfortunate reality manifests itself most notably in the advertisement of beauty products.</p>

<p>Women are especially influenced by the media due to a subconscious desire to feel beautiful. Despite the color of one’s hair or the shape of one’s body, human beings are wired to desire connection with others. And while everyone can acknowledge that there is great beauty in difference, the media has created an arbitrary environment in which users, viewed as potential buyers, are taught to strive for an unachievable ideal. Beauty advertisements promote products as the sole avenue to beauty, using lines such as “buy this shampoo for silkier, smoother hair” or “use this lotion and have flawless skin after just one use.” Between social media influencers, tv commercials, and online advertisements, the advertising world makes us believe we need to be better, act better, and above all else, look better. Advertisements are designed to persuade and make people believe perfection can be purchased. Together, the persuasive nature of these advertisements, combined with our stubbornness to acknowledge this lure, create space for insecurities to flourish.</p>

<p>What would you say if someone asked you to describe your physical appearance to a complete stranger? Is your nose too pointy or your chin too fat? Do your eyes squint when you smile or do you hate the way your forehead crinkles? The way we perceive ourselves, especially our physical appearance, plays a significant role in the ways we carry ourselves, interact with others, and engage with the online world, especially beauty advertisements.</p>

<p>Beauty advertisements are designed to specifically target the human desire for intimate human connection by offering us products as solace and substitutes. Ads fragment the body to showcase certain parts that meet social expectations and then utilize language that places responsibility on the user to buy new products to reshape or transform their body in order to fit the ideal (Ghannam). In reality, the media has carefully crafted a definition of beauty that is based solely on physical appearance, emphasizing a slim-yet-curvy figure, silky-yet-voluminous hair, and tan-yet-clear skin. Individual differences make it impossible to achieve this definition of beautiful, however, women across the world continue to strive for this definition of outward perfection by investing in new products and services. We pay for gym memberships and buy organic products to fight for that perfect figure. We invest in expensive shampoos our hair dressers recommend and pay for treatments that make our hair perfectly straight when it is naturally curly. We go to tanning beds to make our skin the perfect golden brown, but leave the salon with wrinkles and skin damage. Striving for the media’s definition of perfection is a never-ending cycle that revolves around a virtually-constructed perpetuation of the ideal body. Ultimately, advertisements turn wants into needs by “creating an emotional appeal that subtly convinces the audience that the item being promoted will make a difference in their lives by either making them happy, giving them status, satisfying a desire, or providing security” (Weiss).</p>

<p>Applications, games, and social media sites only aid in the process of crafting the ideal. Video games with female characters are designed according to the ideal body in order to entice users to engage with the game on a more personal level. For example, Lauren Croft, the star of the Tomb Raider video games, was digitally created to meet society’s expectations. “Her pouting red lips, her long pony tail reaching to her waist, and her over-sized breasts and eyes are all carved from the virtual media world of an ideal sexuality” (Lancaster, 88). Croft has gathered more money, fame, and power than many real people, all due to her seemingly perfect appearance that was crafted with an ideal “beauty” and sexual desire in mind. In addition to video games, editing applications, such as Photoshop and Adobe Lightroom, allow users to redesign and edit “imperfections” of oneself to meet desires regarding physical appearance. Editors of magazine covers especially utilize these tools to manipulate photos of celebrities on magazine covers.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, a desire for unachievable qualities or goals, in this case beauty as the media defines it, can have detrimental effects on an individual and on society as a whole. According to the Social Comparison Theory, individuals determine their worth based on how they compare to others. Facilitated through the media, comparing oneself to others can boost one’s self confidence positively or negatively, depending on the degree to which one experiences the need to compare. When the effects are negative, escaping the cycle is close to impossible. Beginning with social comparison, insecurities and negated self-worth quickly arise. A lack of respect for oneself or others leads to bullying or putting others down in order to better oneself. Bullying leads to feelings of betrayal, worthlessness, and sadness. This spiraling effect not only brings the comparing person down, but several others that fell in the path of destruction. In the current age, increased media exposure fosters an unhealthy environment for comparison, affecting nearly every woman that has access to the Internet.</p>

<p>Furthermore, social comparison and a desire for beauty fosters feelings of envy towards others, especially social media influencers. In his investigation into females’ envy towards social media influencers, Jiyoung Chea suggests envy arises under four conditions: there are perceived similarities outside the desired characteristic between the female and the influencer (e.g. both are young women), the desired attribute is personally relevant (e.g. wanting a flat stomach for a beach trip with friends), the person is not confident in her abilities to obtain the attribute (e.g. no matter how hard she works out, she still has some flab), and the envied person’s advantage is considered unfair (e.g. “But she eats French fries for lunch every day!”). For young women especially, media-defined beauty is the biggest source of envy (Chea, 248).</p>

<p>Although the desire for beauty has persisted as an effective persuasion architecture in advertisement, it is clear the intention and direction of these advertisements needs to be changed. Luckily, several agencies have taken significant steps to redefine beauty in the media.</p>

<p>In addition to redefining beauty in campaigns, social media influencers are speaking about their experiences within the public sector. In her Ted Talk, “Look aren’t everything. Believe me, I’m a model,” Cameron Russell discusses her experiences within the modeling agency, boldly stating that she, too, is insecure.  She even says models, with the thinnest thighs and the shiniest hair, “are the most physically insecure women probably on the planet.” She ends by stating, “I hope we all become more comfortable in acknowledging the power of image in our perceived successes and our perceived failures.”</p>

<p>It is clear we, as a world of insecure people desiring connection, are beginning to take small steps towards shifting our gaze from a definition of beauty based on an ideal to one that encompasses and celebrates difference. And although this is a monumental, altogether beautiful, and wonderful change for society, we cannot stop here. According to Jo Swinson, “A diversity of body shapes and sizes needs to be included in our magazines, advertising and broadcasts, and on the catwalks.” We need to continue moving away from appearance-based advertisements and encourage beauty from within. We need to diversify the runway, and the bodies we consider fit for a modeling career. We need to steer away from Photoshop and showcase natural beauty on the covers of our magazines. Most of all, however, we need to teach self-confidence and body image literacy so young women across the world feel comfortable in their own skin, and free to talk about it when insecurities arise. </p>

<p>Now, take the image you crafted at the beginning of this essay and go look in the mirror. Odds are what you see is a lot more beautiful than the sketch on your phone. You are beautiful, start believing it.</p>
