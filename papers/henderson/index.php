<p>How do you convince someone to buy something they don’t need? This has been a question that shady salesmen, scams and now videogames have sought to answer for decades. The answer is dependent on the industry you are in to some extent, though there are some commonalities between them. If you are selling an accessory then you convince the buyer that they cannot live without this item, or that it will take an everyday task that feels arduous and make it easy, and even fun. If you are running a scam then you prey on the weakness of people, you target the vulnerable, namely the elderly. Pretend to offer a service like technical support or financial advice, and then invent a problem in that field that they need you to solve because they themselves are incapable of doing so or even understanding. If the elderly aren’t the audience for you then target the poor and offer something that seems almost too good to be true. A vacation to the Bahamas perhaps, or even an opportunity to win a cash prize. That is what the lottery is after-all, pay me and I might pay you… if you’re really, really, impossibly lucky. At a completely functional level, after-install purchases in videogames are really no different. You pay real money for visual character upgrades, and season passes that don’t serve any purpose other than making you look cool. While this sounds like a bad business model, Fortnite pulled in 1.9 billion dollars in 2019 doing just that. It was hardly just Fortnite that raked in the cash with this method though, League of Legends made $1.5 billion, and free-to-play games as a genre pulled in a whopping $88 billion in 2018 alone. How? </p>


<h5 class="subheading">The Numbers</h5>

<p>Free-to-play games made up 80% of the games released in 2019. Meaning that the free to play genre should make a lot of money seeing as they have a massive share of the money-spending videogame player base. The next reason why this genre has taken off is because of the simple psychological concept that they are built around. We as humans like to feel accomplished, especially when it comes to our spending. People like to think they are getting a deal, no matter what they are buying. That is why something that is $100 is almost always priced at $99.99 in the US. It doesn’t matter the quantity we just like to tell ourselves that it was a good deal. Free to play games operate with the same logic, people feel like they are getting a deal by playing them. </p>

<p>The average pay-to-install game released in 2020 costs $60 to purchase and play. So, if you are downloading a game for free then you can easily tell yourself that you are saving $60 right off the bat. The free-to-play game itself is typically pretty bareboned though. The gameplay is there and it typically is very fun, if it isn’t fun then no one will keep playing and all was for nothing. Companies are hoping that you enjoy the game and will keep playing it on a regular basis. This regular playing will cause you develop an emotional attachment to the game. That emotional connection is what these games are banking on, literally. Free-to-play games offer after-install purchases such as skins, and season passes, and while these unnecessary expenses seemed wasteful when you first got the game they become quite tempting once you start playing regularly. Even more so when other players start buying them, because suddenly everyone around you looks cool and you are stuck looking like the new guy.(Relevance, 2018) On top of this peer pressure, skins and season passes are usually pretty cheap, $4.99-$24.99, which is a pretty good deal considering you did get the game for free. So in this scenario, let’s say you pay the $10 for a season pass and you start unlocking all the cool and exciting content and it all seems worth it. You do this again because the new season has even cooler skins and unlockables, then suddenly you’ve been playing and paying for 5 seasons and you’ve spent a total of $50 on the game. Even then you still tell yourself that it’s a good deal because, the average game costs $60 anyway. Let’s say you stop buying season passes after the 5th season though, mathematically the game made less money off you than if they had made you pay an upfront $60 to download. Technically they did make less off you individually, but now multiply your $50 by the 250 million other people that downloaded Fortnite from 2018-2019.(Gilbert, 2018)</p>

<p>That is, essentially, the secret that game companies figured out with free-to-play games. If you offer a free game then, on average, you are going to have a significantly larger player base download and try it. Not all players that download the game will continuously play it, but that is expected, the key is to simply retain as many as you can. Players that do enjoy the game and play it regularly are then known as core players, they are the gamers who Fortnite and other games really care about because they are the spenders. This is not a small number either as, according to a study by LendEDU, an average of 70% of players said that they had made in-game purchases. Additionally, that 70% reportedly spent an average of $84.67 a person between July 2017-June 2018.(Brown, 2019) Subsequently, Fortnite was making up to roughly $300 million dollars a month in 2018, and pulled in an impressive $4.2 billion cumulatively over 2017 and 2018. </p>


<h5 class="subheading">Sales Techniques</h5>

<p>Let’s take a look at exactly how companies are convincing players to spend money they don’t have to on cosmetic items. It all boils down to something I call the Casino mentality. The Casino mentality is the idea that the longer a game can keep a player interested and active the more money that player will be willing to spend. It is the same idea that Casinos have used since their conception. It is why there are no clocks or windows in a Casino, they want you fully immersed in the game and experience in front of you; because, even if you aren’t a gambler, the longer you are in a casino the more likely you will be to try a game or buy a drink. </p>

<p>
<b>(Insert Casino Mentality Slide Here)</b>
</p>


<p>An extension of the casino structure can be seen in the in-game currencies almost all modern games use to conduct transactions. A lot of games will actually have two in-game currencies; one will be the basic currency that can be earned through playing and in large quantities can buy decent items, and one will be a purchasable one, that unlocks significantly more impressive items. The only way to obtain the purchasable one, as implied by the name is to buy it with real world money. This is also a part of the Casino mentality discussed above, as you are far more likely to spend your purple diamond money, or poker chips in a Casino, in game than you are to mail Epic Games $20 via the postal service. On top of this, most games make it difficult or impossible to withdraw your in-game money and turn it into actual cash. There are some exceptions I will explain later, but more often than not in-game currencies are reserved strictly to be used in-game. This means, unlike Casinos, game companies have a pretty constant stream of money coming in without the need to ever pay players a cash out on their earnings. This also means that games have to be subtle about their overcharging, so they keep prices low and always make after-install purchases highly recommended, but optional. (Noordzij, 2015) </p>


<p>At its core the videogame cosmetic market uses the same psychological sales techniques that clothing companies use. So, is it so strange that someone spends $5 on a skin for a game they play for hours every day? The answer is no, it makes perfect sense. Afterall, there are a lot of people that spend thousands on shoes that they will never wear just to have them. Skins and cosmetic items have a whole trading and sales industry build around them outside of their respective games. </p>


<h5 class="subheading">Persuasion Tactics</h5>

<p>The virtual trading industry built around videogames is valued at around $50 billion dollars.(Medium, 2017) The industry exists outside the games as the marketplaces are hosted by third parties. These platforms allow players to trade their purchased, unlocked and owned guns and items with other players. These transactions can be a trade of items between players or a sale where a player pays real world cash to another player for an item. The price of these items can be pretty significant. Prices are driven by the same drivers from the real world market, supply and demand. In videogames, it is an item’s desirability and rarity that drives its price. One such example is the Souvenir AWP [Dragon Lore], sounds fancy, it is just a cool looking skin for a sniper rifle, but it is extremely rare. One of these sold for $61,000 in 2018 (Malloy, 2018) because it was rare and someone wanted it. These transactions, though not to such a scale, happen every day and people have even built their careers around the industry and for the smart and patient few it can be a very profitable lifestyle.(Malloy, 2018)</p>



<h5 class="subheading">Trading Industry</h5>

<p>The question still remains though, what practical purpose drives players to spend money on games? The answer lies in their peers. If no one wore skins then there wouldn’t be much of a market for them. You wouldn’t feel left out and likely wouldn’t ever feel the need to spend money in-game. We as humans instinctively want to fit in or stand out, we almost never want to be left out. This is what drives the sale of almost all fashion and cosmetic products, people inherently want to look good and be viewed in a positive way by their peers. (Yarrow) Videogame skins apply to this as well. Game companies know that people have this reaction, that is why most games that sell skins have a pre-match loading sequence that shows off the skin of the players in your squad or on your team. They know that players will judge their teammates and themselves based off their appearance in game. The peer pressure created by these sequences drives players to purchase skins and items. It is an amazingly simple sales technique, but it is very effective. </p>

<p>Free-to-play games dominate the industry right now, and they will continue to do so until a more profitable system comes around. It isn’t a bad thing, free-to-play games are a great system, I play a lot of them myself, I have even spent money on them. They make playing with friends affordable and easy, as everyone who has a working console, computer or device can download and play. If you don’t pay any money then you can play hundreds of hours totally free of charge. It is amazing though how easily influenced we are by those around us, even in game. The longer I play a game the more tempted I am, almost daily, to buy a cosmetic upgrade for my character. The simplicity of the sales technique is what makes it so effective, because we don’t even notice it. The game doesn’t have to oversell their product because the consumer over 70% of the time sells themselves on it. This is the ultimate art of persuasion, the inception technique, all companies have to do is make a game that is addicting and rewarding to play and players do the rest of the work for them. I expect the free-to-play industry will continue to grow as more companies and games join the genre. Eventually a company will figure out a better way to make money out of us, but until then enjoy the free downloads and after-install purchasable content.  </p>
