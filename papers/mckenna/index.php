<p>In 2020, it is projected that political advertisements alone are to reach roughly $3 billion in spending, nearly double the amount of advertisement spending in the last election year of 2016 ($1.4 billion). This number will only continue to rise, as this year the election is aiming to take advantage of the tools that social media has to offer- specifically Facebook. Through the generally recent trend of social media usage, politicians have been slowly catching on to the importance social media, like Facebook, has to offer. With the power of Facebook emerging and technology advancing, companies took action in displaying ads within the Facebook realm, flaunting their originality to each unique user.  Overtime, thousands of companies morphed Facebook into platform completely in control of their users, simply with the use of users’ personal information. To break this number down further, below I have included the total spending from the Top 4 Presidential Candidates as of January of 2020 through the platform of Facebook alone:</p>

<p>When looking at the top 4 candidates in this year’s running election, Facebook has identified the total spending rates for each candidate, taken from March of 2019 to today (via Facebook’s Ad Library). These numbers break down the idea that Trump has spent $26.9 million alone on Facebook, followed by Bernie at $13.3 million, then by Biden at $8.33 million (Guttmann).  These numbers reveal the spending by each candidate on Facebook alone, showing clearly that there is an incredible amount of political advertising that goes into marketing on Facebook.  Meaning, there has to be a reason why these candidates are consistently putting so much money into marketing to the public, right? Through the usage of Facebook advertising techniques, as well as their own personal techniques taken place through attacking posts, politicians are able to use the personal information given on a user and strategically place their advertisements to increase voting.  Whether this happens ethically or unethically, politicians everywhere finally understand the power of social media, and are doing anything they can to use it.</p>


<p>Politicians everywhere are forming stronger connections with Facebook and its Ad Library, as well as establishing sturdy relationships within its community, as Facebook is taking over how advertising has originally been structured. Even just 15 years ago, the structure and purpose of advertising has drastically changed, while today more politicians than ever are directly targeting those who fit their ideal image of who they want to have vote for them (Brader).  Through the generally recent trend of social media usage, politicians have been slowly catching on to the importance social media, like Facebook, has to offer.  This shift from physical advertisements (such as newspapers) to digital advertisements (such as Facebook and Instagram) is causing one of the greatest boosts in marketing history (Hwang).  With this evolution comes integrations and improvements in the advertisement industry, specifically the ease of analyzing likes and followers of Facebook users.  Information is now found at the ease of a politician with the click of a button.  This information is quickly sold to industries, campaign offices, and people for, in politicians’ cases, better voter turnout. It is simple to discover demographics ranging from age and name to emotional and mental status (Baumgartner).  These advertisements can directly target users, usually targeting the correct users due to psychological effects, to allow politicians to always feel a sense of accomplishment.</p>

<p>There are numerous psychological factors that digitally come into play as to why certain ads seem tailored to you, as well as why a user may specifically be interested in the types of ads being shown.  Through psychological effects such as hate advertisements, supportive advertisements, or even just regular unbiased advertisements, politicians and marketers are able to analyze which of these tactics persuade and sway you into a particular direction. Ads are shaped to target based on likes, searches, interests and mutual followers.  These characteristics of Facebook are persuasion techniques that are not in the form of an ad, but greatly benefit the politician using and paying for your information (Brader).  Facebook takes a user’s specific likes and interests and compares to profiles similar, therefore the algorithm correctly predicts what ad a user would “randomly” be interested in.  With this type of technique, Facebook takes this kind of information and uses it to a disadvantage to target with ads someone would be persuaded by. This information is then bought by politicians and is the reason why some ads may seem more personable than others.</p>

<p>By Facebook using information from users’ likes as well as the likes from the mutual followers shared, data hubs can take users’ personal data and compare their actual personality with the digital personality that users have created only via the internet.  In other words, Facebook can determine the type of person someone is through information such as how long one hovered the mouse over an ad, how often one clicks categorical ads or posts, reaction to posts, which followers have the most likes from users, etc. (Auter).  Compiling information such as this only betters the chance that politicians can accurately target the correct users for specific advertisements paid for. Isn’t it crazy how Facebook statistically knows more about you than your husband or wife will ever know?</p>

<p>Users on Facebook are connected whether they believe so or not.  Strangers are constantly recommended through “Suggested Friends.”  This may seem randomized, but through taking the similar data mentioned above, Facebook compares profiles and sells this information to politicians just to better chances of winning elections, changing biased voters’ opinions, etc.  For example, the Cambridge Analytica compiled the exact information from Facebook and was successfully able to bias voters to vote for Trump based off of demographics and information from millions of users (Holman).  This highlights explicitly how personal data can easily be used transcribed and manipulated only to benefit those higher.</p>

<p>One of the more fascinating things behind the concept of political ads is the idea that all personal information on the internet is never private, and how any personal information is essentially “up for grabs” in regard to politicians in this 2020 Presidential election.  With this in mind, one of the perspectives I wanted audiences to understand was the appreciation of how political advertisements are just “pop-up” advertisements waiting to be clicked on.  Through even having a Facebook account, whether one notices it or not, political advertisements are present, and the information taken from each click, hover, and action on one’s keyboard are immediately taken as crucial data for a candidate’s next target.  For part of my interactive project, I formed a video from the perspective of a Facebook user constantly getting targeted political advertisements.  I wanted to create a feeling of competition behind politicians to lure you into their advertisement (or in this case voting) and your data making them fight over who can persuade you the best.  Every 2-3 seconds, a new ad is added with a different politician.  Each ad consists of either hate or supportiveness shown towards a candidate, and roughly a minute long of invading advertisements on the feed of my personal Facebook page.  Below, you can click on the picture and it will directly bring you to the video.  As you watch, reflect and try to comprehend how this represents political invasion of social media, and the constant tracking of Facebook users.</p>

<p>Similarly, I wanted to create another video focusing on the politician’s perspective rather than the users.  With this in mind, I flipped the concept of the first video and moved it to the second.  I decided to use this thinking in alignment and high like/shares/comments with bias towards politicians, but in the eye of the politician.  The video initially shows the candidate who is viewing their own political campaigns’ website, and continuously gets “Facebook pop-up” posts all across their pages.  With adding this feature, it makes the politician feel as though they have “pop-up ads” that are targeted by the users, and the users are essentially “getting back” at the politician.  In this second video, I included both hate and fan based Facebook messages and used the presidential candidates Donald Trump and Joe Biden.</p>

        <figcaption class="figure-caption">This is my video that mimics the idea of "pop-up advertisements" targeted back towards politicians by using Facebook posts from users.

<p>Through this unique perspective of targeting, the user regains awareness of how frequent these political ads are on Facebook.  For the past 10 years, it has been so invading to users’ privacy that Facebook felt obligated to form an “Ad Library,” a library that reveals a specific amount of demographic information regarding targeted audiences, in order to shape a sense of transparency with the users that feel targeted.  But what tactics are making this approach so successful, regardless of private information being constantly exposed?</p>

<p>The idea behind the “persuasion of politics” just focuses on the concept of political persuasion in general, as well as adding the idea of attitude change.  Through these political advertisements, there comes attitude change and change in bias because of the specific targeted users, that is why this is so crucial in swaying voters in 2016 and now the 2020 election.  This transitions into the idea of emotional tactics, those that are used to sway emotions based on psychological or personal connection towards an ad.  This is one of the more popular tactics, as it allows for easier manipulation of users when trying to change voters’ minds about a candidate.  Questioning and reflection by the users are common as only specific types of emotional tactics are used toward people who could easily be swayed (Baumgartner).  Through this, because everyone is connected on Facebook, this social network can almost put most voters more at stake because no information is considered private, and whether or not you think information is kept away, Facebook and advertising agencies will always prove you wrong.  Tying in the pop-up political Facebook video, this summarizes how immune users feel to this so called “invasion of privacy.” The commonality of this is seen through everyday social media, however Facebook and advertisements seen have made users feel as though there should be no worry to this issue, making persuading advertisements become even more persuasive.</p>

<p>In all, politicians are able to use personal information given on a user and strategically place their advertisements to increase voting.  Through diving deeper into the data received by Facebook about users, politicians can successfully execute persuasion techniques not necessarily through the ad itself, but with the data received by these corporations.  Though this is an invasion of privacy, users are still not aware, as this is a common scene amongst nearly all social media platforms. These uses of “persuasion politics” with the breach of users’ data are effective ways (such as emotional tactics and negative campaigning) to manipulate targeted audiences to vote for a politician.  As users who experience this version of targeting every day, whether it is noticed or not, the power behind the like button isn’t just the satisfaction of a post; it’s much more powerful than even we have ever imagined.</p>
