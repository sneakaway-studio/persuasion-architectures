			<h5 class="subheading">Introduction</h5>


			<p>
				Consumer behavior is the study of “why and how people shop and buy” (Speaking of Psychology). In other words, it helps us to understand what brands are doing to convince consumers to pull out their wallets and enter their payment information. For businesses and marketing agencies, it is essential to know what tactics are best suited for the target audience to promote their brand and products. As consumers, understanding our own behavior helps us to reflect on what guides our purchases, how we are persuaded, and what is required to be more resilient to influential and intentionally tricky advertisements. With the evolution of technology, the tactics that drive consumers to make unnecessary purchases have changed. The use of social media, the internet, and email as a medium to distribute advertisements has made a substantial impact. Widespread tactics used today include: bargains, fear of missing out (FOMO), frequency of exposure, and the connection of brands to higher purposes. In the retail industry, each of these marketing tactics lean on the psychological weaknesses of consumers to convince them to make unnecessary purchases.
			</p>

			<p>
				An example is American Eagle’s Aerie brand, which is an intimate apparel and lifestyle retailer. Aerie is undoubtedly excelling at marketing as seen through their profitable growth over the past two years. Compared to the first quarter of 2019, the first quarter of 2021 demonstrated a 17% increase in total net revenue and 34% increase in gross profit (American Eagle Outfitters). By examining Aerie’s marketing tactics it is evident their use of the power of bargains, FOMO, frequency of exposure, and the connection of brand to greater purpose effectively promote their brand and drive their target audience to buy their products. We examine each of these tactics in the context of Aerie, a company who sells non-essentials, to understand how these tactics, which are harnessed by technology, work to companies’ advantage and impact consumer behavior.
			</p>




			<h5 class="subheading">Analysis</h5>

			<p>
				According to Kit Yarrow, people are so attracted to bargains that they often get more excited about the bargain itself than the product they are buying (Speaking of Psychology). It is extremely common for retail companies to have limited time discounts. Aerie is notorious for this; when you walk into an Aerie store or browse their website, you are guaranteed to see at least one category of full-priced items on sale. A common Aerie offer is 30% off sweatshirts and leggings, excluding their most popular crossover flare leggings (we will get to those later). In addition to this, they will have simultaneous promotions such as 25% off new arrivals. If I look back to a previous promotional email, Aerie offered 30% off tops and bra tops. Another example, 40% off leggings, bike shorts, and sports bras. There is always a bargain and they are rotated through very intentionally. The limited time offers compel consumers to essentially buy when it “makes the most sense,” or simply when they think they are getting the best deal. Psychologically, Yarrow states that limited time offers trigger FOMO, or fear of missing out (Speaking of Psychology). Even if a buyer does not love a specific product, the fact that they can get “such a good deal” out of buying it often sways the decision to make an unnecessary purchase.
			</p>

			<p>
				Aerie is very good at creating eye-catching subject lines that induce FOMO in their promotional emails. One subject line specifically caught my attention: “We never do this.” For two-days only in February, Aerie offered 30% off all flare leggings- including the crossover flare leggings we mentioned were excluded from previous 30% off leggings bargains. Most people who pay attention to the pattern of Aerie sales or shop at Aerie know that the crossovers are always full-price and excluded from every legging and pant discount. I have received Aerie promo deals via email for over a year. In that year, this was the only time I had ever seen the crossover flare leggings on sale. So, I knew they weren’t deceiving me when they said “we never do this,” because they really don’t. I mean, why would they ever put their best selling and most viral product on sale if they don’t have to and people will buy it anyways? As a shopper, this feels like the one and only time they will ever be on sale. This is a prime example of FOMO, or fear of missing out on an “incredible” deal. For me and one of my best friends, we knew this would be our only chance in the foreseeable future to get a pair of these highly popular leggings at a discount. So what did we do? We both bought a pair. Not because we needed them, but because this bargain was so good and hardly ever comes around, that we had to take advantage of it. It seemed too good to be true and we did not want to miss out.
			</p>

			<p>
				By implementing bargains, retailers effectively target consumers that are already interested in the brand, but need an extra push or incentive to make a purchase. Bargains and FOMO are extremely important for retaining consumers. However, retailers must promote their brand in a way that reaches and engages their target audience in the first place. Not only does the product need to be exposed to the target audience, but it must also be at an effective frequency. Herbert Krugman spoke of 3-time exposure in terms of psychological response which goes from curiosity to recognition to decision (Arneodo). According to Severine Arneodo, “an ad may need more than three times and via a variety of media to expose a consumer to a message and move them through the psychological response laid out by Krugman.” With today’s technology, there are many ways companies make their products repeatedly appear on your screen. In addition, the frequency you see something also depends on if and how you engage with it. With the abundance of data collected on your activity online, these tactics are continuing to evolve.
			</p>

			<p>
				On social media networks such as Instagram, ad topic preferences are based on engagement. For a new consumer, they may scroll past it the first few times, but if Aerie continues having their ads appear on the screen, it makes them more likely to engage since they are becoming more familiar with the brand the more they see it. Once a user chooses to engage with an Aerie ad by clicking on it, or scrolling through the multiple photos in a post, they are more likely to see it again in the future. Since I engage with Aerie ads almost every time I see them, I get them constantly! Aerie is frequently on my screen and I am being reminded of their products daily. After engaging with a retailer’s website, you are also prone to targeted ads embedded in other websites. When I have the Aerie browser open or viewed it recently, the targeted ads on other websites are often for Aerie. This is another way to get the content to repeatedly show up on your page. These methods for frequency of exposure are key for influencing consumer behavior. By experiencing repeat exposure, it leads to decision, the third step in Krugman’s psychological response. When you reach a decision, which is when you decide if you care about a product, it in turn leads to action (Arneodo). By being faced with decisions more frequently it ultimately drives consumers to action, which means they are driven to making purchases.
			</p>

			<p>
				A study of nearly 30,000 consumers around the world shows that consumers are attracted to companies that stand for something bigger than what they sell (Davies). According to research from Accenture, “nearly two-thirds of consumers globally (63 percent) prefer to buy goods and services from companies that stand for a shared purpose that reflects their personal values and beliefs'” (Davies). More than 65 percent said their purchasing decisions are persuaded by the “words, values, and actions of a company’s leaders.” This demonstrates that consumers not only care about what they are buying, but also who they are buying from. In addition, a company needs to both communicate and demonstrate their commitment to their greater purpose. Senior Managing Director of Accenture Strategy, Bill Theofilou shares that “it’s about having a genuine and meaningful commitment to important principles that consumers care about which inform every business decision.” Aerie’s brand has set a clear intention to serve purposes beyond just selling women’s clothing.
			</p>

			<p>
				Aerie’s #REAL campaign benefits their store’s target demographic, women aged 15 to 25. The REAL campaign is “centered on body positivity and inclusion” (Forbes). This age group spends a significant amount of time on social media; a place where comparison to others is inevitable. This can be especially harmful when comparisons are to highly edited, photoshopped, and “perfect” people online. To combat this, none of Aerie’s models are embellished or edited. Their goal is to make consumers feel confident in themselves while wearing their clothes. The emphasis they put on inclusivity adds value to their brand by giving purchases greater meaning. Their clothes make consumers both comfortable and confident. Aerie also partners with a handful of non-profits like Free the Girls, Crisis HotLine, NEDA, Special Olympics, and more. This aligns with their commitment to serve their brands target audience fostering a shared purpose between Aerie and their consumers. In addition, Aerie is committed to sustainability. Their website states the company is “committed to a decrease of 40% in our manufacturing, which is where we see the majority of our GHG emissions (over 95%)” and they have “committed to being carbon neutral.” In the study by Accenture, they found 62% of consumers are attracted to companies that are committed to reducing plastics and improving the environment. As demonstrated by Aerie’s commitments to body positivity, non-profits, and sustainability, supported by Accenture’s research, a company’s commitment to a mission bigger than what they sell attracts and encourages consumers buying behaviors.

						<summary>Buy or Save by Mary Grace Bunch</summary>

						<p>
							A 2019 article from USA today reports that the average American adult spends $18,000 a day on things they can live without (Backman). That is a significant amount of money and can be detrimental to financial goals. In the study, online shopping accounted for an average of $84.11 per month, adding up to over $1,000 a year. In today’s technology driven world, tactics created by retail companies are continuing to evolve to drive these numbers up. Techniques that get consumers to pull the trigger on unnecessary items can be implemented through the internet, a company’s website, social media, or email. This is what inspired my game. Buy or Save takes consumers through a decision making simulation where they are faced with the common tactics used by marketers in real life. They are asked to respond as authentically as possible such that the feedback at the end of the game can help the player understand their consumer behavior and how these persuasion tactics work on them. If a consumer is looking to become more resistant to the persuasion used by the retail industry, the first step in limiting unnecessary purchases is understanding why you are doing it in the first place.
						</p>

						<p>The game focuses on a single retailer, the women’s lifestyle clothing brand Aerie. Aerie is booming right now and targets women aged 15-25. From my experience, the company knows how to market effectively. For each of the effective marketing tactics I researched, I could find clear examples of Aerie’s implementation of them. These real life examples by Aerie are used in the game. This makes me excited for how players will learn and grow from going through the game. This is an area of persuasion that is worth investing time in because it can help individuals save both money and time.

				When you put these triggers together and they work in tandem with one another, they prove to be incredibly powerful. Suppose that you observe Aerie targeting you with ads on Instagram. You will see these, something might catch your eye, but you probably won’t buy it immediately. Instead, you just observe your own curiosity with the item. You keep going back on social media, and Aerie ads continue popping up, creating a sense of familiarity. With these, you see plugs for their #REAL campaign where they promote body positivity. You start to remember the brand and the types of retail they sell, along with their goal to make all women feel confident in themselves. A bit more time goes by, and you see they are promoting a limited time bargain. Guess what? The sale is 30% off tops, and you remember one of the tops from a previous ad that you liked. Well, knowing there is a sale and it caught your eye before, you are drawn to check it out again. Since it is only discounted for a short period of a time, you do not want to miss out on the offer. 30% off seems like a bargain. Even if there was not a specific top you wanted, you are still drawn to the sale of a company you’ve grown to admire. You don’t want to pass up on your chance to buy when there is a deal, especially since you don’t know when or if you could get the bargain in the future.

				If a consumer is looking to become more resistant to the persuasion used by the retail industry, the first step in limiting unnecessary purchases is understanding why you are doing it in the first place. The tactics discussed in this paper are likely key drivers, along with emotions like sadness or boredom. If consumers recognize bargains are an effective tactic on them, a good strategy would be to unsubscribe from promotional emails (Lent). If you don’t know there is a sale, you will be less likely to go shopping. If a consumer is driven by frequency of exposure, we can suggest trying not to directly engage with ads on social media, because that data is tracked and will lead to a flood of more ads for that same product or company. If a consumer is especially drawn to buying from companies with greater missions, they can try finding ways to fulfill your personal values outside of shopping. For example, promoting sustainability through recycling, taking shorter showers, cutting off lights when you don’t need them, or even donating your old clothing you don’t want anymore. Aside from ways to directly combat the tactics discussed, it is suggested that consumers keep a wishlist of things they want and try to stick to it, create a financial motivation to stop shopping and start saving for something, and composing a budget for nonessential purchases (Lent).

				As described, the retail industry utilizes a handful of key tactics to persuade consumers to make unnecessary purchases. In today’s technology driven world, each of the tactics discussed can be implemented through the internet, a company’s website, social media, or email. It is valuable to note that it hasn’t always been this way. Marketing used to rely on billboards, magazine and newspaper advertisements, and word of mouth. Though it is possible to use the tactics in these mediums, the ability to use technology today has revolutionized the marketing industry and company’s ability for companies to reach their target audiences. A 2019 article from USA today reports that the average American adult spends $18,000 a day on things they can live without (Backman). That is a significant amount of money and can be detrimental to financial goals. In the study, online shopping accounted for an average of $84.11 per month, adding up to over $1,000 a year. In the future, the average spending will only increase if consumers do not find ways to combat persuasion from the retail industry. As consumers set out on a journey to limit unnecessary purchases, it will not always be easy. That is what the businesses want. With that being said, it is important to give yourself grace as a consumer. Be kind to yourself, you are only human. Sometimes an unnecessary purchase is needed to make you feel good. That is part of the process and your growth as you become a wise and self-determining consumer.
