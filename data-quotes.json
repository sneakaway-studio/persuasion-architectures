But the structure of that architecture is the same whether you're selling shoes or whether you're selling politics. The algorithms do not know the difference. The same algorithms set loose upon us to make us more pliable for ads are also organizing our political, personal and social information flows, and that's what's got to change.",

Hope - “Under the definition given, Foursquare, for example, is not a gamified service in itself, though it possesses potential to gamify (and, thereby, enhance) other services, such as restaurants or bars, through rules, goal-setting, variable outcomes, feedback, and rewards.” - from “Understanding Gamification of Consumer Experiences,” this speaks to my research because it emphasizes that games do different things for different people, and it allows me to get into why corporate gamification is so well-recieved

Virginia - “Facebook and Google assert with merit that they are giving users what they want… The same can be said about tobacco companies and drug dealers” - Jason Rosenstein, former developer at Facebook & inventor of the like button

Henry - “Ronald McDonald does not advertise unhealthy food to children. We provide many choices that fit with the balanced, active lifestyle. It is up to them to choose and their parents to choose, and it is their responsibility to do so.” -Jim Skinner, Former McDonald’s CEO

Owen - “YouTube’s recommendation engine algorithm isn’t a partisan monster — it’s an engagement monster. [...] Its only governing ideology is to wrangle content — no matter how tenuously linked to your watch history —  that  it  thinks  might  keep  you  glued  to  your  screen  for  another  few  seconds”  (O’Donovan  et.  al.,  2019).

“ In an ideal world what I'd love to see is consumers just look at the product, not even look at the price, decide if they like it or not and then look at the price.” - Kit Yarrow. Bargains are the “achilles heel” of advertisers today. We would love what we had so much more if we didnt consider the price, rather just the product.
